The heroes or villains you choose don‚Äôt have to be currently in HS but you have to be able to imagine them as a HS student by day while spending their time after-schools undergoing these adventures.

Some of the first characters that come to mind for me would be:

- Peter Parker

- Spider-Gwen

- Kamala Khan

- Johnny and Sue Storm

- Harry Osborn (Green Goblin)

- Scott Summers

- Emma Frost

- Black Cat

- Illyana Rasputin",Marvel

ho4xkl,Don't see any reason to read comics,"I've watched all the MCU movies, and they are just fucking incredible well aside from Incredible Hulk and Captain Marvel because she's just too overpowered and boring 

They are some of the best made movies ever in my opinion and nothing is probably going to top marvel as my favorite films and in the film industry and I'm so happy that's the case

ho7nlu,"Oh, say can you see! Elijah Bradley, aka Patriot of the Young Avengers, is July's Character of the Month!","**CHARACTER HISTORY**
---
  
  
Elijah Bradley was created by Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung and debuted in *Young Avengers* #1 in 2005.  
  
Unbeknownst to most modern readers, there have been many star-spangled heroes centered around Captain America, most notably Sam Wilson/Falcon and Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier, both of whom donned the mantle of Captain America in recent years. While Sam Wilson is probably the most well-known African American character to become Captain America, it was Isaiah Bradley who carried that title first. Isaiah was the only one of 300 AA soldiers experimented on with a super-soldier serum in the 60s. His son, Josiah, carried on the family tradition in the Vietnam War, while his daughter was born before he received his powers, resulting in her son (Isaiah's grandson), Elijah, having no powers.  
  
After the Avengers split up, Iron Lad (a time-traveling younger version of Kang the Conqueror) begins to recruit a new team in the New York City area, with Josiah being one of his first targets. Eli steps in and lies about having powers so that he can join the team. He then began using the illegal Mutant Growth Hormone pills to fabricate superhuman abilities. Wearing a costume very similar to that of Captain America's original sidekick, Bucky, Eli donned a full cowl and a set of five-pointed throwing stars as Patriot, and alongside his new teammates Hulkling and Asgardian, formed the Young Avengers. He later finds Captain America's original shield during an attack on the Avengers Mansion. When he is forced to reveal the origin of his powers, he quits the team, but rejoins after Hulkling is captured by the Super-Skrull. During the subsequent battle between the Kree, the Skrulls forces, the Young Avengers and the New Avengers, Patriot uses himself to shield Captain America from gunfire and is severely injured. After the battle Captain America rushes to the hospital to give Eli a blood transfusion only to discover ""another Captain America"", Eli's grandfather, had already given Eli his blood. Since the transfusion, Eli has gained physical attributes and powers of a real Super Soldier.  
  
Along with the rest of his team, Patriot sided with Captain America and the Secret Avengers against the Superhuman Registration Act, which led to the Superhero Civil War. When the Skrulls invaded Earth (*Secret Invasion*), Patriot joined the other Young Avengers and Runaways on the front lines of the battle. Patriot, along with the other Young Avengers, helped rescue the fallen from Asgard during the Siege. After the events of *Children's Crusade*, Eli leaves the team and moves to Arizona, where he works in voter registration.

I'm debating on which one to get because I have enough now to get 8.0 and have 10 bucks extra, but I also want to get Crisis on Infinite Earths #1 which they have had for a while as well. This one is 7.4 I believe but costs the same as the 6.3 Infinity Gauntlet.

hoe1c7,It must really suck to be a fortune teller in the MU,"I mean between the time travelers and mages and beings with reality warping powers the future you see in the morning may not be the one you see at lunch or by dinner. 

No to mention the number of different timelines, alternate realities, universes, making it hard to tell if the future you are seeing is even the correct one for the timeline/universe you are currently inhabiting. 

Then lets say you take a reading on someone that says they are going to get hit by a car but you see *them* later and they are fine because they are a version from a different timeline or a skrull disguised as the person you met that morning.

Well we all know Marvel has given the license of its heroes for a fair chunk of video games in the 90s and early 2000s. But moving on the games became fewer and fewer, to the point only Spider-Man game was being made. Granted the past few years have been a bit better with a great Spider-Man game + the new Avenegers game announced (which I have no hope for since the previews were awful) and the new Iron-Man game, but with the success of MCU, and the amount of money gaming generates its really baffling to see Marvel being so reluctant to either enter gaming or at least proactively license its ips to studios. 
Characters like Wolverine, Captain America, and groups like X-Men and Avengers are definitely household names and the brand recognition will be huge. So I can't still find out why Marvel is so hesitant to dive into gaming.",Marvel

Setting: Victor‚Äôs study at the monastery 

Victor is seated facing the cliffs. Pondering his next moves. Conflicted with the thought his mother may be alive. Filled with rage he begins to work. Assisted by Zora doom crafts his first suit of armor merged with runes and magical enchantments. Clunky and primitive looking, akin to the IronMan Mark 1. Despite its appearance though its able to make forcefields and energy projectiles without incantations of hand movements Doom sees himself finally ready to take over the false Barons final stronghold. Through careful espionage we see Victor and Zora have positioned themselves amongst a group of radicals ready to overthrow the tyrant. They fuel the coup d‚Äôetat when Victor demonstrates his abilities and assures them if they fight with him, he can and will kill the baron. 
 Victor kills the false Baron as promised, in front of his men. With the bright red sun blistering at his back creating a dull glare off of the rusted armor
Victor:
‚ÄúNow pledge yourselves to me, people of [insert town name] i have come not to rule you but to lead you, lead you into a future where we can be seen one of the world powers, a sovereign nation free from the tyranny of evil men. What say you my ppl‚Äù 

And the crowd begins to mutter ‚ÄúDoom‚Äù 
Which becomes a chant 
Doom, DOOM, 
As they roar Doom the camera zooms in on his armor. 

Zooming out from the gray statue now standing in the middle of the same town square it zooms out to reveal It is now early spring, frost melts off the statue. Small flowers growing amongst the morning dew.

While he normally fight them until a standoff, it seems like Thor and Sentry would be theoretically more powerful.

Hulk is my favorite, though I‚Äôm not a fan of more than two personalities. I like Banner the scientist who means well and misunderstood. I like what that stands for.

It is not the total number of comics sold to customers, as that kinda thing isn't tracked as much and a comic's success is really only indicated by whether or not it gets a second printing (meaning it essentially sold out everywhere). These numbers and rankings are in essence the ""box office results"" for the comic industry.

ggdif5,I have an idea for a comic book story,"Tony stark as iron man is fighting a villain called Project 02 with armour as high tech as his it's got a different colour scheme of camouflage instead of red/yellow Tony is losing and it's causing a lot of damage across the city. Stark punch's the villain in the face and he goes flying into a building. Stark gets the upper hand and in a final gambit the villain fires missile at a nearby building with people in and it starts to collapse. Tony stark has to save the people inside and the villain escapes. 

After searching for the villain Tony goes back to the tower to find Project 02 with a gun to peppers head. Tony tries to blast Project 02 but accidentally kills pepper. In anger Tony kills Project 02 and destroys the suit. Project 02's son is actually the genius who made the suit. He is 18 and called Jack Audier. Jack starts building project 03 and says ""Dad failed to kill him and so did Alex. It's my turn"".

 The avengers have to fight Loki as he has broken out of Asgard. He has an army of robots to his aid.The avengers are losing and struggling to protect the people and Iron man looks around and sees people dying and being injured and decides to stop Loki ever hurting anyone again and he kills Loki. The other avengers are angry and Tony leaves the group.

 Meanwhile Jack has finished Project 03 and it is an all black iron Man suit with white repulsors and on his left hand a white circular saw. Tony stark is all alone in his tower and creates a new suit with green instead of red and blue instead of yellow and a red arc reactor. Renames himself death metal and vows on peppers grave that he will kill anyone who hurts the people of Earth. Later that week Tony hires a new assistant. Jack Audier is given the job.

3 months later Jack Audier is figuring out stark towers layout to perfectly plan how to kill Tony stark. And Stark is out fighting. Stark returns to find Audier doing this and tries to send him to jail Jack puts on his suit and they have a massive fight across Manhattan. Tony Stark s new Laser technology can cut through anything put Audier is strong and his saw tears through Starks armour after a vicious fight with lots of casualties. Tony doesn't give up though he's bleeding from the side and his armour is weakened but the fight goes on. Tony blasts Project 03 in the arm and they carry on fight until Stark loses his focus and his arm is chopped off. Project 03 is destroying Tony and all Stark can do is try to survive. 

Caps shield fly's in and knocks Audier away before he can deliver his final blow. The Secret avengers quickly defeat Audier and save Tony. Stark gets up and kills Audier. The avengers arrest him and stark gets a life sentence in prison.In prison the sinister six breaks everyone out and Stark gets his armour and escapes however a bit of venoms symbiote gets on the armour and landing at stark towers venom takes over and they become a symbiote version of death metal and both say. Death Metal must save the world.",Marvel

fwf1yh,"When it comes to Comic Book films or TV adaptations, should the director make his own vision or Listen to the fans?Movie/TV","Every one has their own way on how they want their favorite work to be adapted but if you know how Hollywood, the Internet, the general audience and hardcore fans work, its a lot more complicated than that. But two most popular opinions when it comes to adaptations is either let the director do what he wants with the property or directors should listen to the fans and serve them what they want. Now I know many will easily in the comments will easily say ""Why not both"" but if you know how filmaking works, that can sometime be impossible. Movies (especially genres like superhero movies) are quite expensive to make and studios want appeal too as many fans as possible. The MCU is doing a fantastic job appealing to the masses with amazing success but it gets a lot of criticism from filmbuffs and few comic book fans for playing it too safe without much unique visions in each films. But then you have films like Joker which is completely deviates from it's source materials and was a financial and critical success but got a lot of backlash from comic fans for again deviating from the source material. So in your opinion want do you want from a comic book movie adaptation? And not just superheroes but any comic book genre

In my opinion, I always say that directors should be free t make the adaptation with their vision as long as they understand the source material, not necessarily respect it. Their is this claim that producers and directors should respect the source material but I disagree to some degree. There a lot of movie adaptations that were made by filmmakers who weren't necessarily fans of the original source material but understood it and wanted to use the work to tell their own story. Movies Like Jurassic Park, Dredd (2012) , Starship Troppers are examples of this, one of the biggest example I know is Nicholas Meyer who wasn't a fan of star trek but used the universe and it's characters to tell the story he wanted to tell and in doing so he ended making the most beloved Star Trek film to date, ""The Wrath of Khan"". Hell even Keving feige wasn't a huge comic fan as he said in his Ama, and that he was more into things such as Star Wars, yet he is the producer of one of the biggest Movie Franshise in History based on said comic properties. That's cause they are able to chose what works and doesn't work for the big screen.  

As a hardcore comic book fan, I acknowledge that there are some things that just don't work for the big screen. Many say a comic book adaptation should be a beat by beat faithful adaptation but there is a reason why no comic book movie to this day has a title like that because certain things are just to grand and may I say, ridiculous that the general audience and even some comic fans will be left scratching their heads or thinking ""WTF!?"". I know genres like superheroes are known for it's ridiculousness and Insanity but not a lot of professional filmmakers are willing to embrace it and they do they do, they could end up turning off the GA who are an important audience for these movies as well as hardcore or casual fans.

Now do the alternative is of course animation like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse where the filmmaker can embrace the source material to the fullest as much as they want. I absolutely approve of this as I'm also an huge fan animation and feel it doesn't get the respect it deserves in the film world and the public. I've always felt characters Superman work better in animation after seeing the old Max Fleischer animated shorts, but sadly animation is too expensive, too niche, and not every charter is as popular as Batman or Spider-Man to get a well animated big screen adaption and still rake in the box office Bread.

In summary, Comic Books and film are two different mediums. Some elements just don't mix with the other which is why filmmakers should have free reign as long as they fully understand what they are adapting.",Marvel

fwj0x8,What is the correct way to read through the major Avengers events?,"Hello! I‚Äôve recently started reading marvel comics, but in having a problem that I‚Äôm hoping people can help me with. Coming from the MCU I‚Äôve been reading sagas/events that were adapted to films like infinity saga and civil war (but only civil war 2). Whilst they‚Äôve been great reads I often find myself not really knowing what‚Äôs going on since I: (a) don‚Äôt recognise certain characters and; (b) am clearly missing backstory. 

Cap is my favorite character so I‚Äôd like to read more big events which feature him, mainly civil war (the original) and secret empire. But I‚Äôd like to go into them knowing all the backstory this time. So I was wondering if I could get some guidance around what to read and in what order to read it for leading into these events.

fwpsbm,Here's how I would have fixed Rhodey/War Machine in the MCU,"  

I was rewatching some Avengers films and I noticed that despite Rhodey being there amongst the gang, he felt out of place. So, I had some free time and thought up some quick dialogue or scene(s) that could have helped bridged the gap. Yes, he's a secondary character but often it felt he was overlooked or made to be lesser when good writing could have achieved far more.

So, Iron Man 2 was pretty good IMO with regard to screentime and characterization for Rhodey.

Avengers. He's nowhere to be seen. Which is perfectly fine. The annoying thing is it's not mentioned at all in the next films.

So for Iron Man 3, I'd have liked to have a scene of Rhodes and his military superiors mentioning his success on his mission thay happened during the Battle of New York. A 60 second scene would have been enough to establish why the Avengers didn't call him in. I'd also have liked a short scene of Rhodey at his home being called in to report to duty. He'd have a kinda ""suit up"" moment when called in for a missing. This would reveal a little of Rhodey's home life. Maybe everything is in perfect order. Maybe we see he had a notecard to call his parents or to callback a woman he was setup with. Real quick scenes.

Age of Ultron. I thought it would have been nice if we emphasized this was the first time Rhodey met Cap and Thor. So he addresses himself as colonel and maybe he mentions the hero Cap was to him during officer training. And maybe also he's kinda awestruck by Thor as a ""God"". Which then leads to the scene about the tank and the general's palace. See, I feel this would help give the audience a feeling of Rhodey feeling inadequate or even out of place. He's a military man. Hell, maybe even Thor calls him out and ask where he was during New York and he mentions he's an active duty officer. Maybe we even get a brief dialogue of Stark asking Rhodey about joining the Avengers. Maybe even a line of Stark saying he can put in a good word for him. Total of maybe 2 minutes heck even 90 seconds if written tactly.

Civil War is my favorite of Rhodey's appearances. The scene with Rhodey and Sam indicate Rhodey's trust in the military and organizations with Sam's distrust. Pretty interesting as Rhodey is an active duty colonel while Sam is former military and may be bitter about his time in the service.

Infinity War. I'd have liked ten seconds more of him kicking ass in Wakanda. Just going all out in combat. Maybe even include a shot of his amazement at Wakanda upon arriving with the rest. It's his first time there afterall. Early on, i'd have liked an add-on to his scene with General Ross. Ross asking about Stark and Vision and he has no idea. Ross asks the last time he suited up and he mentions Germany. Ross even says they're gonna need him more than ever. We get the feeling he's antsy about putting the armor back on. Then Cap arrives. Maybe a quick look from Cap and the gang at Sam's leg braces. After embracing, Cap begins to apologize about that day at the airport and Rhodey shuts him down and says he's long moved past it. So again, more focus on his injury as well as he having some trauma over it but he's ready to push past for the greater good. In the movie, it's as if his injury is brushed past and he joins Cap's gang like nothing ever happened.

Endgame. I feel he was alright. A bit flippant with his humor though. The missing moment is a big action sequence. I'd have shown like 30 seconds of him joining Tony and Pepper kicking some ass. Maybe also have him taking out one of Children of Thanos on one-on-one combat. Also, it would have been nice for when Tony arrived, maybe he was the one that Tony spoke with instead of Cap. It reinforces their bond seeing as they had zero scenes together in Infinity War.

So what do you think? Very minor scenes but give us a far greater understanding of Rhodey with his commitment to the military but also the pain and trauma the injury had on him.",Marvel

If not where should I start?," For the past few weeks I've been reading New X-Men, I'm about 9-10 issues in and I just haven't been a fan of it so far. I don't really like the art and I'd prefer for there to be more characters in it. The main characters in it are mostly Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, and Emma Frost. I know there was a big event before the series that wiped out a lot of characters, but this just isn't what I'm looking for in my first X-Men series.

 I guess that's kind of how people felt in the new 52 when they had Superman dating Wonder Woman instead of Lois.  Just kind of lessening my enjoyment of the story of small bit.

I know people haven‚Äôt been *really* fond of it, but this is the first ongoing series I‚Äôve been reading from the start (kinda, I caught up in the trades), but I have some questions about what I may need to read. 

First, the upcoming Empyre event. I know that Aaron‚Äôs going to be working mostly on the Moon Knight storyline at that time, but Jim Zub is working on a miniseries for the event. There‚Äôs also Mark Waid working on a Squadron Supreme mini for the same event. Will either of those be required reading? Or will it be more of whether Aaron chooses to reference the events in his stories? I know they had a few tie-ins to War of the Realms, but that was also written by Aaron.

Second, other ongoing series. I remember seeing in one of the recent Venom issues that they offered Eddie a place on the team. Donny Cates is good friends with Aaron, especially since he took over the Thor title from him. Could we see Venom join the team in the near future? And if so, should I start getting into the current Venom run?

Same thing with the X-Men. Jason Aaron said at C2E2 that with everything going on with the Dawn of X (coupled with some of the plot points in Avengers 31), that it feels inevitable that the X-Men will come into conflict with the rest of the Marvel Universe, with the Avengers being a big candidate. If so, should I start getting ready with the Hickman X-Men, or dive in with all the Dawn of X titles?

I appreciate any help offered.",Marvel

\-Frog-man: A giant mutant frog from space who wants to take over the earth. his only power is that he has special guns that can do pretty much whatever the hell they want.

\-General Cossack: A crazy communist general who really only exists so cold-war hulk can fight a Russian army

\-Mongu: A giant guy claiming to be a gladiator from outer space, but is secretly a communist in a fake suit with no superpowers at all

\-Metalman: Magneto before magneto, except this one is an alien.

However, I've been finding the early issues to be a drag. I'm sure this probably isn't a popular opinion, but I haven't been enjoying the classic (?) Spiderman issues at all, specifically Amazing Spiderman. I haven't read a ton of comics, but most of what I've enjoyed has been for the character interaction/dialogue and the overarching story. Both of these seem pretty lacking in the classic issues, the dialogue and individual stories are extremely dry and the stories are so basic and uninteresting.

I understand that the whole point of reading in chronological order is seeing the origins and different interactions and group formations. But how important is that stuff? In my opinion, none of the origins have been that amazing or noteworthy so far (I've only read the first ~50 in the list). I've read a few Spiderman comics about 10 yrs ago that I really enjoyed, so I know that it isn't the character or anything, it's just these old issues/stories I'm not liking.

So what I'm wondering is whether reading the early chronology is that important, if there's an alternative to reading them (a summary or something) and where would be a good point to pick up from if I were to skip it?

Andy Serkis sounds very confident about the second Venom movie! The first one was a mess in so many ways, and part 2 can go in any direction whether in a good or bad way, but I do however trust his judgments! He is a VERY charismatic and passionate artist, whether he is acting or directing and he's proven to be Oscar worthy with both!

Does the hammer judge technology? If not is that how Vision was able to lift it in AoU, and could Up from have lifted it?(yes I know comics differ from MCU), If yes does it only judge on sentience? Would one of Tony's remote piloted suits be able to lift it since theres not true sentience inside? Do Otto's arms count as sentient enough to be judged by the hammer?

I know it works differently in the comics as it gains mass when someone unworthy tries to lift it, and the rate at which Hulk gains strength from anger exceeds that of which the hammer gains mass meaning Hulk can eventually lift it out of pure strength, but I'm unsure how the enchantment works with technology. Any answers to this would be greatly appreciated",Marvel

ek5nwy,Why Stucky is the best relationship in the MCU and Marvel.,"All of us in the Marvel fandom know about a certain relationship that is so well known and what most of us like: Stucky (Steve Rogers/Captain America and James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes/Winter Soldier) the subject of so many shipping fanfics on Tumblr and social media, fan art, the hashtag campaign #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, a cosplay kiss and even a comic panel in *The Unbelievable Gwenpool* showing the two together on a beach along with Gwen Poole/Gwen Pool and Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel.

The MCU version of Stucky is so much better than the comics counterpart which was just simply the usual ""kid sidekick, adult hero"" dynamic/teenage assassin meets hero gimmick instead however we get a fully-fledged relationship that spans childhood, adolesence and adulthood not just years but decades from the 1920-1930s pre-World War II era to World War II to the present day until the end. The MCU version of the relationship is really well-done and the chemistry between Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan sells it so well. Stucky has even been described as ""a love story"" by the Russo brothers and ""each other's soulmate"" by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. When you look at Steve Rogers and James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes no pairing in both the Marvel Universe and especially the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is so natural that they you could say they are brothers something acknowledged by the Russos themselves no less. 

Even *Marvel Comics #1000* made some changes to the comics version of the relationship to be more like the movies with a short story that depicted pre-World War II Steve Rogers and James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes playing with each other in the snow as children. Of course I hope it's retconned more so it matches well. I would consider it one of my favorite relationships in Marvel Comics history if not the best period alongside T'Challa/Black Panther and Ororo Munroe/Storm, Scott Summers/Cyclops and Jean Grey/Marvel Girl-Phoenix, Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Miles Morales, Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel and Mar-Vell/Walter Lawson, Katherine ""Kitty"" Pryde/Shadowcat and Piotr ""Peter"" Rasputin/Colossus and Anna Marie-LeBeau/Rogue and Remy LeBeau/Gambit.

[I made a post 6 months talking about the comics I read that far](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/c7op2q/my_experience_with_marvel_unlimited/), which got absolutely no traction. But i still want to write down my thoughts on comics, 'cause its fun and I got no one to talk to about this stuff.

# Secret Wars (2015)

I didn't like it. I definitely don't think I like these big Marvel crossover events very much. It might be that since my comic knowledge isn't as verbose, it just feels like really weird stuff happening with a ton of characters some of which I have no idea who they are with no consequences. I realize there were a few big shake ups that happened because of Secret Wars, but they seem kind of artificial. Like Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman go missing to recreate the entire multiverse, I don't know. It seems like the multiverse is destroyed a whole lot and for it to be rebuilt so easily seems to remove any threat level of multi universal threats. And I guess Miles Morales gets moved to Earth-616 because he gave Molecule Man a 7 year old hamburger...I mean if Mr. Fantastic and family are rebuilding the multiverse then why would they not rebuild Earth-1610 so Miles could just go home? I don't know...just seems odd. But sometimes you just need to not think about it and just have fun.

# Howard the Duck (2015)

It's funny and fun. I think these kinds of weird meta-humor comics are the ones I like the most. And its ending was extremely meta. I don't feel it's as good as the other comedy super heroes that I've enjoyed, like Squirrel Girl and Gwenpool. Not to say Howard the Duck is bad, it was really enjoyable and I had a great time reading it. It's just...I was hoping for a bit more maybe? Or maybe less...? Like the Abundant Glove is both hilarious yet disappointing as a MacGuffin. Like the 2 dance gems, that's comedy gold. And there are some really poignant and introspective moments Howard has. And some really funny cross overs. But something just feels like it's missing to make it great. I just don't know what it is.

# Spider-geddon

It is both better and worse then Spider-verse. It resolved strangely and hopefully in a manor that the Inheritors will never be villains ever again. And the fun stuff was fun, like Spider-ma'am, Spider-Ben and Petey, VEN#m; and fleshing out other spider-heros like Spider-punk and Peni Parker, etc. Spider-Gwen kind of got benched for the whole thing, which was a bit weird, but from the few comics I read of Ghost-spider, it looked like she had a far more interesting and meaningful to her storyline narrative anyway.

# Spider-Gwen

Went back and finished off Spider-Gwen. It was good but I felt like it was loosing focus towards the end. Like Gwen got caught up in a lot of mellow drama. I realize that's pretty par for the course for Spider-man story arcs, but...I don't know...Harry sucks... And they seemed to focus on him a lot. I felt it was pretty fun up until the Spider-women event. I feel like Cindy Moon really messed with the direction of the narrative. The Venom symbiont played out very differently from what I was expecting. I feel like the pay off for Matt Murdock being defeated wasn't very rewarding.

# Cosmic Ghost Rider

Freaking amazing. I honestly, just wish this series was longer and could really explore the concept of Frank Castle trying to raise Thanos into being a better person. It kind of just short cuts itself with a time skip. But the potential narrative and story exploration is huge. Also seeing wacky alternate reality hero mashups was great. My favorite being Howard the Duck combined with Juggernaut. I want a comic book about that concept.

# Wolverine: The Old Man Logan part

I actually started reading this because I read a post on reddit where people were shitting on how grim derp Frank Miller is. And so I was a bit morbidly curious about what it's all about. The most annoying part was that the *Old Man Logan* series is a continuation, and not the start. So I had to do a bit of research on the internet to find out it was *Wolverine* \#66 and ends in *Giant Size Wolverine: Old Man Logan*. Anyway, it was surprisingly fun. The story was very tight and to the point. I feel the only weird thing is that Logan kills 3 out of the 4 super villains that control most of the USA. Like why hadn't anyone got their act together sooner if Old Man Logan could single handily do it over the course of a few weeks.

# (some of) Old Man Logan

I enjoyed the bait and switch on how this tied in to Secret Wars. I stopped reading after the second comic where he entered Earth-616. As much as I normally crap all over cross overs, I think this one worked better...maybe? I don't know it also sucked because it takes agency away from the original narrative, which I'd honestly prefer to explore more. I think a story about Old Man Logan roaming the wastelands as some kind of post apocalyptic cowboy raising an inbreed hulk baby. Like that concept is just gold... I assume *Dead Man Logan* is that, so I'll have to check that out later.

# Old Man Hawkeye

It's a prequel, and I think is retroactively ruins the themes established in the original Old Man Logan narrative. This is not to say that it's bad. It's actually pretty fun. But I did feel a world taken over by super villains in which all the heroes died was a very interesting hook. But by establishing that some heroes are alive but in hiding, I feel really weakens the narrative.

# The Infamous Iron Man (with a bit of Invincible Iron Man)

So I had no idea what happened to Tony Stark. I knew from Squirrel Girl he was comatose and replaced by an AI of himself, or something and then wasn't. Also from Gwenpool I knew Dr. Doom became Iron Man. Anyway, it was fun to read this and get a bit of backstory on what was happening. It takes itself very seriously, which I can honestly respect. But Dr. Doom's ""power level"" seems to kind of fluctuate. Like he's incredibly over powered until his appearance in *Invincible Iron Man* where he seems to be threatened by some super villains I've never heard of before. It just feels wrong.

Also not a big fan of the foreshadowing of Maker being the major villain followed by it not being. I felt like evil Reed Richards is the perfect arch nemesis to Dr. Iron Doom. That just makes sense. Also the exposition dump when the true bad guy is reveal was a bit much. I realize to make it understandable to me the audience, I needed it. But, it's like the one time it stops taking itself so seriously and lowers the stakes.

# Deadpool Too Soon

I needed more Squirrel Girl in my life so I started to look for other comics where Squirrel Girl appeared. This was ok. It was funny. But it felt like the stakes were artificially raised when people started dying, which obviously meant nothing was going to matter by the end. The premise is good, Deadpool investigating a party murder mystery which he was inadvertently responsible for. That's honestly a funny concept. And the execution is good. But it's not the Squirrel Girl I was looking for. So maybe that's why I didn't like this as much.

# Marvel Rising

Speaking of more Squirrel Girl. This was also ok. The parts written by Ryan North was the Squirrel Girl I was looking for. It was fun but I don't think I liked it that much. Just doesn't seem all that impactful to either Ms. Marvel or Squirrel Girl's narratives.

# Deadpool the Duck

I did enjoy Howard the Duck. So I thought I'd like to read some more Howard the Duck. This was ok. It was funny, but I felt Howard didn't have the same personality that I grew to love from this 2015 run. It just felt like rambunctious comedy with Deadpool as a cartoon duck rather than a continuation of Howard the Duck comic with Deadpool. Probably should have realized that's what it'd be since Deadpool is the more popular character.

# Vote Loki

Figured I wanted to read more of Christopher Hastings work, so downloaded this. I knew Loki became a good guy, and I guess I need to read *Loki Agent of Asgard*, which is on the list of things I want to read. But this was funny. And there were little introspective character moments that I really love about Hastings work. This was a really great read.

# The Unstoppable Wasp

I started reading it just because I saw Gurihiru did the art and I love them. This is honestly not at all what I was expecting. It's pretty woke. I'm not using that ironically. This is a pretty progressive comic. Nadia Van Dyne also has to manage her Bipolar Disorder, which I feel like can help normalize mental health treatment. Despite all the things I feel this comic is doing write. I sadly feel its very uninteresting. Like there are way too many characters. I kind of just feel like it's hard to focus on what's suppose to be the central narrative. So it just becomes a bunch of things happening in an art style that I like without me becoming invested in the characters.

# Ms. Marvel

My friend told me to read this. Also I became a bit curious about Ms. Marvel after reading *Marvel Rising*. It's amazing. My new favorite super hero. I am a huge sucker for someone doing the wrong things for the right reasons. So to see Kamala break curfew to help save some dumb ass runaway kids. That kind of stuff hits me right in the feels. And the fact she loses sometimes is also nice. She's just trying to figure out this super hero thing. It kind of reminds me of why I used to really love Spider-man. I also super enjoy the exploration of Muslim culture through the lens of comic books. I think that's super cool, and I honestly wish it played an even bigger role.

I feel the Inhuman tie in is garbage and distracts from the more personal stakes I want explored. Like I don't know who Lineage is and I don't care. New Attilan is the capital of the Inhumans, and he takes it over, but he's a bad guy, but he's an Inhuman too; so is he apart of New Attilan? Like how did he take it over? How did he lose control of it, because a few issues later we go back there and everything's back to normal. It's like they don't even bother to explain what's happening, so I just feel lost with all this Inhuman junk.

Also, a thing I super respect. Visual gags everywhere. It's so fun to just see all the little jokes hidden in the background. I love it. Also, while on the topic. The art work is gorgeous. I really got to checkout more stuff by Adrian Alphona. I guess he did *Runaways*, so I'll need to check that out sometime.

# I am Groot

I wanted to read a bit more Chris Hastings. So I read through this. It was fun and short. Started weird but it was good. Once again, Hastings is a master at writing comedy and character introspection. I really love that guy.

---

So that was my time with Marvel Unlimited. It was great. Comic books are fun. Hope you enjoyed reading through my wall of texted to see what I thought of a few of these comics.",Marvel

It is pretty clear that he won't be villainous in Venom 2, but I don't want him too heroic. Sony made the mistake of showing the broad side of his heroism in part 1, which was already an objectively bad movie. 

Considering how horrible the script/writing was for part 1, there's more than enough room for fixes to happen in part 2. Eddie's writing was quite horrible and goofy, he needs to be written more realistic and organic. 

I beg Sony to not try tonely mimicking MCU with their universe. I'm fed up with lighthearted crap tbh, Spider-Man is an exception because he's got a great balance of dark and light imo.",Marvel

&amp;#x200B;

* 1- on earth stark is a genius and his ironman armor is the highly advanced technology that no one was able to make a perfect  replica of it , but compared to the FTL civilizations out there with their advanced technology it shouldnt be that special and yet it is , so why is that ?

in fact i believe with their level of technology something like power armor which is what ironman armor is would be the stranded issue for foot soldiers or at least special forces and yet i havent seen anything resembling a powered armor , then again i know about the lore from the movies only 

&amp;#x200B;

* has stark ever did some reverse engineering to any of the alien tech , i mean with all these wrecked alien tech (ships ,weapons and other stuff) he should be in dreamland with all this tech just lying around , but nope he didnt seem to care much as if there is nothing new to learn from it just like how he acted when he was stuck on that spaceship casually fixing it before captain marvel saved him .

&amp;#x200B;

* how come earth has all the crazy stuff like mutants and unique technologies like PYM particles that other aliens dont have but somehow humans cant manage to achieve FTL or at least colonize the solar system ?

dre46s,Disney X-Men Movie Plot,"We start in a plane as it's crashing, with their parents putting Scott and Alex Summers in the only parachute. The parachute catches fire, falls too quickly near the ground, and Scott hits his head on a rock. They become wards of the state, and are separated. Scott ends up in the State Home for the Foundlings, where we see examples of anti-mutant bigotry, and Mr. Milbury (Mr. Sinister), who tests and experiments on Scott to 'try to fix the brain injury'. Scott, now sixteen, befriends a young girl, and as they're getting closer, Scott's powers manifest, and he injures her. Not badly, but too obviously for her to hide it. The girl runs home, and Scott tries to get control of his powers, squinting to try and see without releasing a full blast, slowly making his way towards the orphanage, causing a public scene as he goes. When Scott finally gets close to the orphanage, the girl's family is waiting outside to confront him. He tries to wrap his eyes up with his sweater, but they pull it off of him, and an unintentional eye blast injures one of the assailants. They express anti-mutant bigotry, and prepare to exact retribution on Scott, when everyone freezes. Professor X appears to rescue Scott, explaining his dream, and they walk away. We're introduced to an early version of the School. Professor X studies Scott in the lab, with Hank's assistance, explaining mutants, and the subtle brain damage that keeps him from having control of his powers. Scott briefly explains the plane crash, and Mr. Milbury's experiments on him. Scott has to keep a blindfold on for now. Scott talks to Bobby and Hank and Warren, and we learn a bit about what makes each of them tick. We also get a little exposition about mutant terrorism looming. There's a montage as we jump forward two years, we see Scott and others training in the Danger Room, but it's not obvious they're doing combat training yet, it seems more like a gym class. We see shots of normal student life as well, the four boys socializing. We also see Hank and Charles getting Scott to fire his beams through different translucent lenses, destroying them all until the final scene, when they land on rose quartz, and Scott's power is controlled. Scott puts the glasses on, staring up at the ceiling when he first opens his eyes, and when he sits up, the first thing he sees is Jean Grey, who Charles introduces as a new student. Unfortunately, Charles has to interrupt the introductions, as he has something to ask of them.

Cut to news footage of the Brotherhood of Mutants having committed a grievous, public terrorist act, making demands, and the social repercussions thereof. Charles needs to speak with his former friend, but Magnus is invulnerable to his telepathy, and he's afraid he might not let him go without a fight. Charles asks the students to go with him to confront the Brotherhood, to use their powers to protect him should it come to that. Scott asks Charles if the Danger Room training they've been doing has been preparing them for this. Charles admits he thought it might come to this, and he has nowhere else to turn for help but to his most trusted students. Jean wonders why she's to be involved, she just got there. Charles says she's also telepathic, so if he's taken out the team will still be able to communicate with each other long distance. Charles says it's their choice, and if they refuse, he'll go it alone. Scott agrees to go first, and everyone else does so after.

The team examines the news footage to identify some of the mutant powers that were used in the attack. Charles uses Cerebro to track down the other members of the Brotherhood based on their powers, identifying the location of their base. Charles starts to charter a plane, but Scott has a fear of flying due to his childhood trauma, so they take a train. Magneto and Charles discuss their differing philosophies, and reach an impasse. Magneto tries to recruit the X-Men, Charles tries to recruit the Brotherhood members, which Polaris subtly seems sympathetic to. Charles tries to leave, but Magneto won't allow any of them to leave because they know too much and they could decide to rat them out. Charles tries to talk him out of it, but it turns into a fight. Charles expects to be able to shut down the Brotherhood except for Magneto, but they're all telepathically immune due to wearing more subtle versions of Magneto's helmet, which is a surprise to Charles. The Brotherhood is well led and very organized in their battle tactics, but through their powers, Charles and the students just barely escape.

Charles says he regrets asking the students to come along, that it was too dangerous for them, they're not even really adults yet, and that they all could've died. Charles will pursue his dream alone. Scott says they all want to make a difference, and that none of them can back out now that they know the danger the Brotherhood pose to everyone. They've got the power to save people, and they've got to stop Magneto, and show the world that mutants aren't evil, before he convinces all of humanity to hate mutants. If they don't do it, nobody else will. Charles agrees to accept their help, but only if they're prepared to work together as a team under Scott's leadership. Charles insists that he's not their leader, that he's just asking them for their help in realizing his dream, and in exchange, he'll teach and mentor and support the group. A student bursts in with terrible news.

We cut to a dark scene, where we see a Church of Humanity leader with several mutant hostages, preparing to execute them. He gives a speech about mutants being evil. ""These are not men! Once these unholy, demonic powers welled up in their bodies, they ceased to be men, they are now too corrupted to be considered human! They are ex-men!""

The X-Men sweep in. Scott's leadership, telepathically transmitted between them by Jean, guides them to using their powers together more effectively, and they rescue all the hostages, disarm the Church of Humanity, and nobody gets hurt. Scott is interviewed, ""Is this a superhero team? Who are you?"" ""You heard him. We're the X-Men.""

Another montage of the X-Men training together among other school life, and everyone's competing romantic interest in Jean. We quickly see them defeat the Vanisher, Unus the Untouchable, and the Blob, leading to them being thrown in plastic super prison. The X-Men are growing in popularity, support for them as superheroes is increasing, and many people claim the X-Men have proved to them that mutants could be heroes too.

We see Magneto in Brotherhood HQ. Polaris asks him how they're going to free their brothers, and Magneto says everything until now has only been leading to their final move. He taps a screen with a small tropical island on it labelled ""Krakkoa"".

Cut to the X-Men interviewing possible future X-Men from the school, and we quickly meet Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Sunfire, and Thunderbird, as they interview to be new X-Men. The X-Men say even though they feel like they should recruit them, it may mess up their chemistry as a team, and make it harder to communicate. Suddenly, the Brotherhood are on the news again. The island of Krakkoa is rapidly moving towards the city of San Diego. Magneto claims that in mere hours, the island will crash into the city, destroying everything. Magneto demands the recognition of Krakkoa as a sovereign island mutant nation, he wants all the imprisoned mutants in the world to be released to his custody, he wants all mutants everywhere to have the right to emigrate to Krakkoa, and he wants enough money and resources to build Krakkoa up into a utopian paradise for mutants, claiming the cost to the US and the world will be far less than the loss of San Diego would be. He gives them a time limit before Krakkoa hits the city. He also says they shouldn't bother trying to stop them because no human can approach Krakkoa, only mutants can, as the island attacks all humans that get near. Magneto also claims he's been playing nice with Charles and the X-Men so far, but this time, if they interfere, he will kill them, or worse. We see the US military and navy attempting to approach Krakkoa, only for the Brotherhood or the island itself to destroy any human vehicles approaching. The X-Men aren't sure how they're going to get to Krakkoa, and Warren and Hank reveal the Quinjet. Scott isn't happy about flying, but he agrees to face his fear since there's no other way for them to get there. The X-Men candidates offer to join them, but Scott confidently says they've handled the Brotherhood before, and they'll do it again.

The X-Men go to Krakkoa, and the island hands them their asses, and captures all the X-Men except for Scott, who manages to escape to the Quinjet, injured. Krakkoa keeps the other four X-Men alive in plant-like pods, and keeps draining their powers, keeping them alive but torturing them to power itself up. Polaris asks Magneto if this is the right thing to do and Magneto handwaves it as being necessary for the cause. Polaris is upset.

Scott is flying the Quinjet back towards San Diego but it's taken damage, and it starts to crash. Scott starts having a panic attack, flashing back to the plane crash in his childhood. Polaris appears to rescue Scott, guiding the Quinjet down safely near the San Diego harbour. Polaris is recognized as a Brotherhood member and they have to hide. Scott and Polaris manage to escape human notice, and Polaris starts giving Scott first aid. Scott says he failed the team as their leader, that he was overconfident and it led to their downfall. Polaris explains that it was Scott who first made her question Magneto's teachings, that when she saw how hard he fought for his beliefs and his team, that she knew there had to be something to it. Scott says he knows she was always sympathetic to the X-Men, and asks her why it took so long for her to turn and join them. Polaris explains that she's Magneto's daughter. Polaris also explains that she knows everything there is about Krakkoa, and that she can help him rescue his friends. Scott bemoans that the two of them aren't enough, and that they have no way to get there. Charles arrives with Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Sunfire, and Thunderbird, in costume. Scott says they still have no transportation, but Storm explains she can get them there on the wind, Sunfire can fly, and once they get close, Nightcrawler can teleport them in. Charles will use a portable Cerebro unit to keep them telepathically connected from San Diego. 

They attack Krakkoa again, and it goes better at first, but then goes bad again. Magneto kills Thunderbird, and all seems to be lost, when Jean Grey regains consciousness, and telepathically communicates with Scott. Jean sends a message: ""Krakkoa is a person, Scott! Krakkoa is a mutant!""

Following the guidance from Jean's telepathy, Scott finds a passage into a cave inside the center of the island, and Polaris follows him down soon after. A pod similar to the ones the other X-Men are in opens up in front of him, and Polaris warns him not to go in, but Scott enters it anyway. Scott and Krakkoa become connected, and we see how Krakkoa was created by nuclear experiments led by Mister Sinister, and Scott shares Xavier's dream with the island. He explains: ""Separating ourselves from humans will never lead to us being accepted or happy. We can only learn to love and accept each other, and live together. Magneto's way can only end in disaster."" The telepathic link between the two gets more intense as they share memories and thoughts rapidly, until Krakkoa is convinced, and lets out a loud, strange, bellowing cry.

Krakkoa comes to a stop very nearby to San Diego, showing how close the city was to being hit, the change in momentum knocking everyone on their asses, and the island starts to sink. Flowers bloom underneath the surviving X-Men, creating platforms and carrying them up above water, while Magneto and the Brotherhood members (except Polaris) are trapped in pods by the island, and dragged under. Scott and Polaris emerge from under the island's surface and are also lifted up by a flower platform. Krakkoa carries the X-Men to the docks of San Diego, and lets them go, before disappearing underneath the waves.

The news interviews Charles, who gives a speech about unity between mutants and humans, eulogizes Thunderbird, and explains that the X-Men will always be there to save everyone, human and mutant, even those that hate and fear them. All the X-Men come together for the finale.

Mid credits scene, we see Mr. Milbury watching Scott on the news. He expresses regret at losing control of two of his favourite experimental projects, as we see him turn into Mister Sinister. He'll never regain control of that island, but at least Scott wasn't the only available source of Summers DNA, he says, as Alex steps into view, as Havok. ""Maybe it's time I brought my brother home."" We get an exterior shot of the State Home for the Foundlings, which has been shut down and is empty and dark.

Post credits scene, we see a figure covered head to toe stumbling down a dark, snow covered alleyway, looking despondent and drunk, and carrying a brown paper bag. He sits down beside a garbage bin, and takes off his balaclava, revealing him to be Magneto. He unscrews the cap of the bottle he's carrying, and takes a long drink. A gravelly voice from beside him asks, ""Had a bad day, bub?"" He turns his head, and the camera pans to the side, and we catch a brief glimpse of Wolverine sitting beside him before we cut to black.",Marvel

Most of them seem to be ""stepping stone"" teleporters, transiting via some other place, like Nightcrawler, Magik, Lila Cheney, or the Vanisher (the Brimstone dimension, Limbo, a Dyson Sphere, and the Darkforce dimension, respectively).

Others manipulate the fabric of space-time to achieve teleportation, like the Origamist (one of Legion's personalities), or like Jean Grey as Dark Phoenix did, after smacking down the X-Men in Central Park and heading for deep space.

Other reality manipulators, like Jamie Braddock, can do something similar.

My question is, are there any other ways teleportation is portrayed, in the comics?",Marvel

dd1bxv,Character Origin Timelines,"Hey, I'm trying to figure out the appropriate timelines and had some questions.

I have always wanted to get into comics, but it just seemed like too massive of a project for me. Also, not being able to read things in order bothered me, but now with Marvel Unlimited and all these other options, life is much simpler. I'm having a really good time reading things all the way from the beginning. Its like being a part of history or something. To watch a character evolve and progress and to one day see where the modern elements take part.

Some questions I had.

&amp;#x200B;

Why was the ""Incredible Hulk"" series cancelled after just 6 issues? I guess it's due to sales, but they didn't give it much time to run. Hmm, one issue per month, I guess after 6 months, they can make a valid decision based on sales. What other comics had their runs real short like this? Where does Hulk continue next? Is it in Tales that Astonish with Giant Man collab and then it goes back to Hulk having his own at 102?

Comicbookdb seems to be a great resource. Is there a way that you can look up the exact timeline for each character appearance? I know Marvel Unlimited seems to have it in order on their site. I'd just like to read a website that has it clearly which comics go in which order.

I was never a big fan of Ant Man until the movies came out. Paul Rudd was excellent and he got me into it. I didn't plan on reading the Ant Man comics while I started but after reading about 20 issues of the Avengers, I said why not. And you know what? It's not bad at all. Hank Pym is a legit player in the Marvel world and is essential reading as far as I'm concerned.

It's hard to get good conversation about all the ins and outs about these topics, I tried the discord but caught serious flak for applying divergent thinking to various theories. Where is a good safe haven to explore theories and ideas about the Marvel Universe which isn't so stuffy? CBR? 

Anyway, this has been a lot of fun, looking forward to learning all the ins and outs. 

Oh, I thought it was pretty cool to see how quickly Dr. Banner is able to merge his mind with Hulk's body. Banner is able to figure this out within the first 5 comics, pretty amazing stuff. 

Read a lot of Thor so far, in about 120 issues deep. Ant Man and Iron Man about 20 each and just started Hulk. Going to read Spider-man, X-men, Avengers and Fantastic Four as well. 

Going to be a great year, tons of comic reading. And coming from the olden days going into the new, its going to be awesome when I start hitting those really good stories because the old ones are entertaining me plenty.

What about Sub-Mariner? He seems like essential reading, is it worth getting into Namor?",Marvel

Well, maybe he did. Maybe he did turn back time to revive Tony. But that caused Thanos to get revived before Tony. Thus, it could be one of the 14 million possibilities where the avengers lose. What do you think?",Marvel

dd8t7x,Who are your Top 10 favourite Marvel superheroes?,"Marvel without a doubt has the best superheroes! So here is my list of my top ten favourite Marvel superheroes! 

***My Top 10 Favourite Marvel Superheroes:***

10.) **Ben Grimes/The Thing** \- My favourite of the Fantastic Four.

9.) **She-Hulk** \- I love her 616 version. She's big, beautiful and a badass! Has Hulk's strength and still has her intelligence! Overall, I just really love her!

8.) **Daredevil** \- One of my favourite grounded superheroes. Despite being blind, he proves to be an absolute badass in combat. 

7.) **Doctor Strange** \- The Sorcerer Supreme! I love magic characters and Strange is definitely the best one! 

6.) **Iron Man** \- I'm a little biased about this one because my main reason I love him is because of the MCU. I'm not really a fan of the comics version much. 

5.) **Black Panther** \- The KING!!! He is such a badass. He can be ruthless when he needs to be, but at the same time, still prove to be heroic. 

4.) **The Punisher** \- The ultimate antihero. Frank Castle wages war on criminals and is the ultimate vigilante. He is dark, ruthless and brutal... and that's why I love him. He does what other heroes won't. If a villain goes down when another hero fights them, they are helped back up. But when a villain goes down when the Punisher is dealing with them, they stay down. 

3.) **The Hulk** \- I absolutely love the Hulk. The angrier he gets, the stronger he gets. Though he does have a limit to how angry he can get, he can still reach the level of destroying worlds. Overall, he's alot more powerful than many adaptions make him out to be. 

2.) **Spider-Man** \- Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! He is just such an amazing character! Peter Parker is a really relatable character, then as Spider-Man, he always continues to be entertaining. Plus, he has the best rogues gallery! 

1.) **Wolverine** \- It was a tough choice between one and two since they're both very close to each other in terms of being my favourite but at the end of the day, Wolverine ended up in first place. He is just so awesome! He has the coolest power, is an antihero, has a snarky personality and overall, looks the coolest! Thanks to Steve Blum and Hugh Jackman, they only increased my love for the character. 

So who are YOUR Top 10 favourite Marvel superheroes and why? :D",Marvel

While collecting Daredevil I picked up 5 deluxe hardcovers covering Waid‚Äôs two runs. And this quickly became my favorite format. I bought Soule‚Äôs volumes as trade paperbacks and they‚Äôve never been collected in any other edition. Now that Zdarksy‚Äôs run has a trade out with more coming I‚Äôm wondering if there is any chance of it being collected as HC anytime soon. The same with ASM. I got Slott‚Äôs worldwide in the format but I‚Äôm wondering if Nick Spencer‚Äôs run will be collected in the format...

Does anyone have any idea what books Marvel collects in this format and which they don‚Äôt? I don‚Äôt want to miss out on the trades but I don‚Äôt want to purchase twice and prefer the HC. 

What prompted the question was seeing that Coates captain America is getting released in this format. That surprised me - was I too busy collecting to realize that was a popular run or is there another factor going into the decision? How much of it is how will the single issues sell? How much is the popularity of the character? How much is the popularity of the author himself? 

Anyways, any insights would be greatly appreciated.",Marvel

---
  
**PUBLICATION HISTORY**
---
   
Moira MacTaggert was created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, and first appeared in *Uncanny X-Men* #96 (December 1975). Moira was one of the major supporting characters in Claremont's *Uncanny X-Men* run. She worked as a geneticist and was an expert in mutant affairs. She was also romantically involved with Professor X. She would eventually found a foundation center on Muir Island centered on mutant research.  
  
Moira was one of the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series *Chaos War: X-Men*, as well as the X-Men crossover event *Age of X*. In terms of importance, until recently, Moira was quite limited to only being present to be the ""mutant sympathizer,"" serving little purpose beyond that (*see ""extended history"" below). However, as one of the main characters in Jonathan Hickman's *House of X* and *Powers of X*, it is revealed that she was a mutant all along with the ability of reincarnation, retaining memories of her previous lives and using her knowledge to aid the mutant cause.  
  
  
  
**EXTENDED HISTORY**
---
  
Born Moira Kinross to Scottish parents, Moira MacTaggert was one of the world's leading authorities on genetic mutation, earning her a Nobel Prize for her work. She was the longest running human associate of the X-Men and was Professor Charles Xavier's colleague, confidante, and also once his fianc√©, having met and fallen in love with him while they were postgraduates at Oxford University. She ended their engagement for unknown reasons and returned to Scotland. She was married to her old flame, the late politician Joseph MacTaggert which caused delays with her former engagement to Xavier. Joe proved to be an abusive husband; Moira separated from him after he beat her into a week long coma and, as it is implied, raped her, leaving her pregnant. She kept her son's existence a secret, and when Joe refused her a divorce she allowed people to believe she was widowed.  
  
She eventually created a Mutant Research Center on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland. Moira was forced to contain and imprison her son Kevin, later called Proteus, when he developed reality warping abilities and severe psychosis. One of Moira's goals was to understand human/mutant genetics, in order to cure her son.  
  
Moira's connection to the X-Men began long before the team formed. The silent partner in the founding of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and co-creator of Cerebro, Moira assisted Xavier in helping the young Jean Grey recover after the traumatic triggering of her mutant abilities.  
  
Moira was a kind woman who took to helping humans and mutants alike. She rescued a young Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane) from an angry mob, and adopted the girl. She even attempted to treat Xavier's son, a mutant known as Legion who suffered from multiple personality disorder. When a confused, traumatized Cable first arrived from the future, he washed up in Scotland unable to speak English, and it was Moira who stood up for him against an angry mob. Taking him back to Muir Island, he scanned her mind and learned English in the process, as well as the truth about her son, and promised to keep her secrets. She taught him literature and the customs of the time and introduced him to Xavier. They became close friends ever since, being the first kind person Cable met in the present timeline, her later death devastating him enough to leave the X-Men. When Magneto was reduced to infancy, he was entrusted to Moira's care on Muir Island, where she altered his genetic code in an attempt to keep him from reverting to villainy.  
   
Moira appeared at Xavier's call to act as ""housekeeper"" for the team while they were on missions (a position that required her to demonstrate her proficiency with an M16 rifle against a demon within hours of her arrival). Though each of the X-Men formed some sort of relationship with the ""Widow"" MacTaggert, Moira and Sean Cassidy (Banshee) hit it off immediately, forming an on-and-off relationship that would last for the remainder of her life. Proteus' escape and eventual destruction at the hands of Colossus and the X-Men left Moira in a position of ethical compromise again: though Banshee stopped her from cloning her son, she saved his genetic structure on disk to allow herself the future option of bringing him back.  
  
After finding out that her foster daughter, Rahne, was a mutant, Moira was the catalyst for change. She talked a discouraged Xavier into opening his school to the next generation of New Mutants, with Rahne becoming an initial member. She was also an integral part of the support for the X-Men and the New Mutants, providing medical aid including cloning Xavier after the Brood attacks, transferring his mind into a new body and restoring his ability to walk after a Brood embryo nearly killed him.  
  
With the apparent death of the X-Men, Moira and Banshee formed an alternate team based from Muir, and carried on as the leader of the team without him when his duties with the X-Men called him away. Her behavior became unpredictable, her temper impressive, and her decisions harsh and unforgiving as she displayed behavior that made all who knew her suspicious. On Muir, she began to pit her charges against each other in an arena in merciless battles, supposedly allowing her the opportunity to study mutants in action. Moira and her islanders were involved in the return of Proteus due to the influence of Advanced Idea Mechanics. This was a four-part story in 1991, that ran through that year's annuals for the *New Warriors, X-Force, New Mutants* and *X-Factor*. The Shadow King, the corrupting entity behind the island, allowed the Islanders to act heroically in defense of innocent lives. Eventually, the entire population of Muir Island was identified as being possessed by and mentally corrupted by Shadow King, pitting the Islanders against the combined forces of the X-Men and X-Factor before Xavier freed them from his control.  
  
Moira's alteration of Magneto did not go unnoticed indefinitely. Enraged when he discovered Moira had tampered with his free will, Magneto took Moira captive and forced her to perform the procedure on half of the X-Men, turning them against their teammates. While Moira's alterations worked, it was revealed that, due to mutants' powers requiring their body chemistry to operate in a specific manner, use of a mutant's powers would cause them to automatically resist the 'programming' and reverse the effects of the procedure, so anything Magneto had done was of his own free will. While hostage on Asteroid M, Moira witnessed Fabian Cortez draining Magneto of his powers and manipulating him into placing him as his right hand. Though Cortez fled, it was an observation that would eventually put Moira back in the hands of the Acolytes. Back on Earth, Moira was unable to accept her betrayal of her surrogate family and her own infallibility, and fled the X-Mansion, with Banshee in pursuit.  
  
When a mysterious virus began attacking the genetically engineered mutate population of Genosha, Moira volunteered her services as a geneticist and was forced to watch as the former slaves were decimated by disease. Returning to the X-Mansion, Moira found Illyana Rasputin suffering from the same illness, later identified as the Legacy Virus. Moving back to Muir Island after the girl‚Äôs death, Moira became the key figure in working for a cure to the disease (during this time, she also worked on curing Wolfsbane's artificial bond with Havok).  
  
The European superhero team Excalibur took up residence on Muir Island after assisting Moira. She had been attacked by agents of Mister Sinister who was seeking the genetic information on her son. Moira became an official member of the group, acting as their medic, team mother, and morale officer. An information leak revealed her to be the only human infected by the Legacy Virus‚Äîa bizarre turn of events possibly caused by her long exposure to the infected on Genosha, her autopsy of Illyana, or some susceptibility because she gave birth to a mutant. Despite these events, she maintained a strong outlook on life, helping to maintain discipline, reduce tension, and increase the team's effectiveness throughout Europe. She convinced the team to stay behind when Onslaught emerged, telling them they might be needed if other heroes fell.  
  
Conferring with the X-Men's Beast did not result in appreciable progress. Locking herself in quarantine in a final attempt to cure the virus without endangering any of her teammates, Moira found her attempts foiled by her foster daughter, Wolfsbane, and Douglock. Wolfsbane originally leapt through the closing doors of the laboratory as the quarantine took effect. She soon found herself a willing assistant to her foster mother's work. Douglock later caused much unintentional damage, his judgement clouded by personal feelings for Wolfsbane. Moira takes time off from her research to attend the bachelorette party and the wedding for her friends Meggan and Brian Braddock.  
  
Moira did eventually find a cure for the disease, when the terrorist Mystique manipulated her research to force the virus to target only humans. Mystique, partly assisted by Sabretooth, then destroyed Muir Island, de-powered Wolfsbane with the power nullifier once developed by Forge, and brutally injured Moira. Bishop, Wolverine, and Rogue attempted to save Moira's life. Despite Rogue's powers temporarily granting her medical knowledge, she was unable to do so. Moira clung to life long enough to mentally transfer the information to Xavier in one final embrace between the former lovers. Xavier nearly went with her into death, but Jean Grey and Cable intervened on the astral plane, talking him down. She died in the X-Men's jet, far above the Atlantic Ocean, and was later buried in Scotland.  
  
A psychic representation of Moira was seen as an active portion of Xavier's consciousness as he worked on rebuilding Genosha. Her ghost has also been seen in the rubble of Muir Island, directing Banshee to a hidden room full of video files.  
  
Moira is next seen in the afterlife, in which she, Mockingbird, Gwen Stacy, and Dead Girl assist Doctor Strange in battling a being known as the Pitiful One. Moria finds herself more interested in the book club she formed with Mockingbird and Gwen Stacy then in battling evil.  
  
After the events of M-Day and upon the reawakening of Vulcan, significant portions of Moira's history with Xavier and the Original X-Men are called into light. During the early years of Xavier's Academy, Moira founded and ran a secondary facility not far from the Xavier School, in which she had her own students; youths whom she took out of bad situations and adopted as her wards, training them in their abilities without the highly militant regimen of Charles' X-Men.  
  
When Krakoa captured the original X-Men, it was Moira's students whom Charles went to first‚Äînot the second team of Wolverine, Storm, Banshee, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Thunderbird and Sunfire as it was originally believed‚Äîputting them through the psionic equivalent of boot camp and allowing them to believe they were being trained over months as X-Men. Charles took them from Moira's care immediately.  
  
Moira's students‚ÄîVulcan (Gabriel Summers, the lost brother of X-Men Cyclops and Havok), Petra, Darwin, and Sway‚Äîwere apparently all killed, and Xavier suppressed even the memory of them from his own students, to keep them from going back to save them. Only Moira's project tapes, one made directly after the event before Xavier could suppress the memories, and an abandoned research center remain as clues.  
  
During the ""Chaos War"" storyline, Moira MacTaggert returns from the dead alongside the fallen X-Men members after what happened to the death realms. After escaping from Carrion Crow, the group discovers that Moira has been possessed by Destiny's ghost.  
  
In 2019's House of X, it is revealed that Moira is actually a mutant who possesses the power of reincarnation, starting her life again in the past after her death, aided with total recall of her prior lives. She's also revealed to be actually alive somewhere, having faked her death at the hands of the Brotherhood by using a Shi'ar Golem which impersonated and die in her place. She currently have repeated ten lifetimes, with different outcomes:  
  
**THE 10 LIVES OF MOIRA MACTAGGERT**
--- 
   
**Life 1**  
Moira Kinross was born to powerful Scots nobleman Lord Kinross and when she turned 13, her mutant ability manifested, but due to her passive power, there were no signs indicating that she had become a mutant other than a strong, temporary fever. Living a simple life, Moira meets Charles Xavier, but he passes through without them forming a bond. She later marries a man named Kenneth Cowan and has three children: twin boys Callum and Dean, and a girl named Abigail. Kenneth dies when Moira is 68 years old, and she passes away from congestive heart failure at age 74.  
  
**Life 2**  
Her second life began in utero, having already become fully sentient and possessing a perfect recollection of her prior life when she turned 13. This allowed Moira to appear intellectually gifted, and she was pushed in the direction of academia. She didn't fight her parents' intentions, since she intended to understand her true nature. After she verified that she wasn‚Äôt suffering from psychosis or a disorder, and having living through one life with Kenneth and learning all his faults, she makes a point not to fall in love with him when they met. She enrolls at Oxford at age 16, becomes a biology professor at 20, founds the Muir Research Institute at 31 and at 44 she finally deduced she was a mutant after seen Charles Xavier coming out as one on television. She boards a plane to the United States of America in order to meet him, however, the plane crashes before reaching its destination, killing Moira.  
  
**Life 3**  
Beginning her third life in utero again, Moira made a point of finding Xavier earlier. She meets Charles Xavier when they were both at Oxford University, however she becomes turned off by his arrogance and a thinly veiled god complex. So she instead devotes her life to finding a cure for mutation, which she compared to cancer. Moira founds again the Muir Research Institute, and at 36 she identifies the X-gene. Just when it appears Moira had rid herself of her reincarnation powers,the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants attack the Muir Research Institute. Able to see the future and Moira's ability, Destiny decides to stop her and the cure. With the Brotherhood, she wipes out the lab and shared with Moira the knowledge that the humans would always try to destroy mutants. Before Moira dies, Destiny warns her that if she pursues a cure in future lives, she will find her. She also tells her that she sees Moira living 10, perhaps 11 lives at most. Another complication is if Moira dies before her powers manifest at 13, she won't reincarnate. Moira is then killed by being slowly burned alive by Pyro.  
  
**Life 4**  
In her fourth life, reconsidering the positive nature of mutants and Xavier himself, Moira throws herself into studying the human-mutant dilemma. She meets Xavier and goes on to fall in love with and marry him, with the couple establishing the Xavier School for Gifted Children. She, Xavier and the X-Men fight for the mutant cause for years, but at age 55, Moira is killed by Sentinels. That ultimately means Destiny's vision was right as she warned Moira that humans would always try to exterminate mutants.  
  
**Life 5**  
Now choosing aggression as a response to the violent tendencies of humanity, Moira runs away from home at 13, which is when her powers first manifest, to encounter Xavier a full decade earlier than when they're supposed to meet. Not wasting any time, Moira opens her mind to Xavier so he can see how his dream fails in her past lives. The mind-reading radicalizes him, forcing the duo to form the mutant nation of Faraway instead of a school. It seemed mutants were finally safe from humanity. Yet, Boliver Trask's adaptive-learning Sentinels still make their way to there, and Moira is initially injured in an attack when she was 43 and dies a year later during a genocide.  
  
**Life 6**
Moira‚Äôs sixth life has been completely stricken from the timeline without offering any reason.  
  
**Life 7**  
With the knowledge that the Trask Family is responsible for creating the Sentinels, Moira spends her seventh life eradicating their bloodline. Bolivar, Donald, Gwyneth and Simon Trask are systematically murdered over the span of a decade, with Moira even taking out their children for good measure. But when she thought she had successfully eliminated the potential for Sentinel creation, she sadly discovered Sentinels were still being created. Moira lost all hope when she understood that the Artificial intelligence is inevitable since its discovered and not created. This realization radicalized her as Sentinels killed her again.
  
**Life 8**  
Abandoning Xavier's peaceful dream to foster a safe future for mutants, Moira seeks out Magneto instead. Presenting Magneto with tales of her past lives and his future failures, Moira convinced him to join her. Together they conquered America, establishing House of M. Eventually the Sentinels rise and the War of M began with Magneto dying during the war and Moira dying later while trying to escape from prison.  
  
**Life 9**  
Though eventually a failure, the life defining decision Moira made to turn to Magneto, did validate her radical approach to beating humanity through force. Magneto was simply not enough. To that end, Moira defined her ninth life in the moment she early awoke Apocalypse. Together, they destroy their two strongest opponents, Xavier and Magneto. They then gather their horsemen and launch the Apocalypse War. During the war humans and Sentinels form an alliance and Nimrod came online for the first time which eventually forces most mutants to be driven out of Earth's solar system by the Man-Machine Supremacy. One hundred years later Apocalypse's forces split into two teams, as one group attacks the Temple of Concordance, another group heads into the archives to extract from his vast archives, vital information about Nimrod's origins. Once the info is gathered, Apocalypse sends Wolverine away and stays behind to take on Nimrod once he realizes that his archives are being raided. Wolverine's destination is revealed to be a container that holds Moira MacTaggert in stasis for over 16 years. With the data embedded into Moira through a techno-organic interface designed by Apocalypse himself, she now knows how and when Nimrod was first brought online, but for that information to actually be useful, Logan had to kill her.  
  
**Life 10**  
Moira‚Äôs tenth life occurs in the current iteration of the Marvel Universe.

hnvstt,Unpopular opinion but the entire 'Batman who Laughs/ Perpetua' storyline are some of the worst comics I've ever read,"I desperately need someone to explain to me because I genuinely can't make sense of how they are popular. I know its just a thing people do 'hating on something cause its popular' but that isn't it for me, I really want to enjoy these stories cause I've been buying them for the most part anyway. But I just can't fathom how people are enjoying it so much. 
I feel the Batman who Laughs peaked in his one-shot origin story and immediately became one of the most boring characters I've ever read. Every single story ends with that cliche ""but this was my plan all along"" and its not even good twists. 
I just need somebody to explain the appeal of the character because I honestly don't know what anyone is getting from him.
Writing this having just finished issue 1 of Death Metal and the line on the last page saying ""we know we just blew your minds"" genuinely infuriated me.

TLDR: please tell me how The Batman who Laughs is an interesting character",DCcomics
hnw0ay,The Question,"Awhile back I finally read the 1986 run of The Question and I was blown away. I thought it was outrageously good, great story lines with thrilling and realistic stakes, fantastic artwork, and a hero who was very much a human with real weaknesses and problems. I know he isn't the most well known character from DC but I bet quite a few people still remember him from Justice League: Unlimited. I think with the success of DC's new originals and their partnership with HBO, I think they have a real shot at making something inspired by those story lines. Over the years we have seen a rise in the anti-hero or the fallible hero, one who really may lose against the bad guys or could get hurt. However they are still able to make the hard choices and put themselves on the line to do what needs to be done. I think The Question embodies that ten-fold, all wrapped up in trench coat and a faceless mask with just a taste of paranoia. Ideally it would be great to see something similar to Watchmen but with a third of the star power, some kind of limited run series or multi-part movie. Hopefully I can see something like that in the years to come.",DCcomics

He can‚Äôt find himself stopping big threats, leaving them to people like Green Lantern, Batman etc. He can only help people ‚Äî people who are hurting. Which was what Superman is built on.

He could still have his friends that grew up with him call him Dick, but in his professional life (not superhero but whatever job he gets) could just be Richard or John Grayson. Like it's way more professional to introduce yourself as Richard Grayson or John Grayson. And if he fully wants to move away from Dick (which I hope never happens), he could just get people to call him Gray. Like Richard ""Gray"" Grayson. 

Nicknames that his friends could call him would be RJ, Johnny, Gray, Rich or you know... Dick.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Wonder Woman 84 takes place during the CW DC Crisis on Infinite Earths event.  The crossover showed us that the DCEU exists in the same CW DC universe.  I think this will be used to remove most of the prior DCEU movies either fully or partially from cannon.

&amp;#x200B;

1984: In WW84 we see that Steve Trevor is back.  I don't think that this Steve is the one Wonder Woman knows. He is from another Earth where WWI is still happening. The events of COIE start to occur on his Earth. He happens upon a lab where Ludendorph was building something. Steve jumps through what he thinks is a time portal due to him not fully understanding the German he read in a notebook he found nearby.  He instead ends up on DCEU Earth. He thinks he time traveled 70 years into the future.

&amp;#x200B;

The events of the DCEU Earth's part in the Crisis play out through WW84. Oliver reboots the multi-universe and the DCEU's timeline mostly wiped clean.  Everything except Joker and Shazam are no longer cannon or only partially cannon.

&amp;#x200B;

New Timeline: A few years prior to now.  Joker takes place.   A new younger Bruce Wayne becomes Batman due to a new rise in crime after the events of Joker. Batfleck is no longer cannon. The Earth has just recently found out that super powered beings and aliens exist. Parts of Man of Steel remain cannon here. The Suicide Squad is formed by the US Government to counter potential threats by super powered beings.  Suicide Squad is no longer cannon, the Jared Leto Joker never existed, and the Joaquin Phoenix version is now the only Joker.

&amp;#x200B;

2019: Shazam takes place.

&amp;#x200B;

2021:  The Batman and The Suicide Squad have existed for a few years.   Their respective movies take place.",DCcomics

Everything makes matters, hence why the numbers include every issue that came before it.  Flash is aware of life pre new 52, Superman and Superboy are currently figuring it out. I bet even Detective Comics is throwing in some hints.

What do you guys think?

gz2mz5,Batman: The Definitive History is a must for every kind of Batman fan! Short review and lots of pictures.,"# Batman: The Definitive History of the Dark Knigh in Comics, Film, and Beyond

&amp;#x200B;

[A gorgeous illustration by John Guydo.](https://preview.redd.it/rrg4ix7nhp351.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=353596f50002dfe82c6b4b569b529a303c7fa187)

I wanted this book the moment it was announced like a year ago, but I couldn't afford it. Fortunately, though, I got it a few weeks ago and I've been nothing but amazed ever since. If you are a Batman fan, either from comics, films, TV, animated series, videogames or whatever, this book is for **YOU**! Here's my short review and some pictures at the end.

It is oversized‚Äîbigger than an omnibus... and bigger than an absolute (not by much, though)! It is 400 pages long, and these are a bit thicker, too. Dustjacket and hardback have the same illustation. Its content includes every media Batman has appeared in: mainly (classic) comics and films, but TV, animation, videogames and merchandising as well. There's like a dozen inserts throughout the book, and some of them are detachable (check my pictures!). The text is professional, rigorous and thorough‚Äîit doesn't cover every little single bit of Batman's history, but the main events are discussed in depth.

In short: the book is **FUCKING** amazing. If you like Batman, go get it. Period.

(For my fellow Europeans, the book is usually \~36‚Ç¨ on [Amazon Spain](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1683834372/) (not now, though). Even with shipping (less than 5‚Ç¨ for most countries), it's a complete steal! Set up a price alert with Keepa and get yours asap!)

So whenever a villain shows up that threatens to destroy the earth, why doesn‚Äôt Impulse disappear from existence whenever the villain is close to winning. Like, if the earth is possibly destroyed, then there‚Äôs no future for Impulse to come from, right? If timelines are fluid, how is he seemingly anchored in the present?

I was hoping someone could help me identify an old Superman comic from the 90s that I had as a kid that I‚Äôve been trying to track down for years. 

So I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a Superman comic set in some sort of Egyptian or South American like planet/country. It had two characters, one older and one younger, and they were in a mentor/student relationship I think. If I remember correctly they were helping to build a pyramid like structure while having a philosophical conversion and end up fighting each other in the end with the older character being the bad guy. I‚Äôm 99.99% certain they both had the Superman S shield on their costumes and both were of the ancestry of the region so not Caucasian.

And I am aware this can be seen as a ""no true scotsman"" fallacy. This is nothing but my own personal preferences, and there's NOTHING wrong with if you disagree with me on any of my points.*  


I miss Joker. And I mean what I see as the actual proper Joker. What do I mean by that? Well, the one from stuff like Tim Burton's Batman 1989, the Batman: Arkham games, iconic comics like The Laughing Fish and The Killing Joke and A Death in the Family among many others, whom we also got to see Mortal Kombat 11 now introduce as a playable character: [https://youtu.be/DXjRFCPiFoA](https://youtu.be/DXjRFCPiFoA?fbclid=IwAR1UaUOUb8NHMwI_yoV9-IcJztoclCH6WyzwPDLED0Pq6NrDZ8rxm7mKJkc)

To me, Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight and Jared Leto's Joker from Suicide Squad and the Jeremiah Joker from the Gotham show - and yes, even the one from the new Joker movie played by Joaquin Phoenix - are more than anything just imitations to me only pretending to be the Joker. I'm not saying the new Joker movie is bad - but it feels like a story that originally had nothing to do with Joker that they decided to rewrite into being a Joker movie.

To me, Joker is supposed to be an unpredictable almost constantly smiling unpredictable chaotic psychotic clown with over-the-top traits such as lethal toys and gadgets and colorful costumes, and someone who once fell into a vat of chemicals to turn him into Joker. Also, Batman being accidently responsible for creating Joker by making him fall into that said vat of chemicals? Yes, that too is important to me.

And before anyone says Joker wasn't originally in the comics like I want him to be? Well... neither was Batman in his original comic the way ANYONE wants him to be now. So, that argument means nothing to me. It all boils down to personal preferences either way.

Even stuff like the movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker features Joker the way I want him to be, even though his costume isn't that interesting in it. Not so much in the other Bruce Timm stuff since he's too child-friendly there though, but he certainly has the look and voice and overall character there in those things as well.

But yeah. Point being? I miss the old classic Joker, the one I personally consider to be the real true Joker. I hope we will get to see him one day again in movies and/or shows.",DCcomics

A lot of people were out of character, and a lot of the writing felt kinda ""stupid for the sake of moving the plot along rather than make sense"". I don't have an all-encompassing knowledge of DC's universe, but I read enough comics and watch enough shows to have a pretty reasonable idea of how these characters should act and what they're capable of doing as a baseline. With that in mind (and please correct me if I missed anything with any of these) I've got a few questions about some things that didn't make sense to me:

1. Where was Doctor Fate? We know he exists in this universe, and he can see the future can't he? Why didn't he show up at all and maybe say ""Hey guys maybe this is a bad idea"". Does that mean that every character who died a grisly, morbid death was destined to?

2. Don't other characters that generally work with the league have some form of precognition? Did nobody think to futurecheck this plan before flying to their death?

3. How was Darkseid able to spy on the league through Cyborg's eye? I know he's built on Darkseid's tech in this universe but it would be pretty stupid of Cyborg to not figure out his system fully by this point.

4. Where were all the characters that are Superman-level powerful if not more? How and why was Trigon the only powerful character who could stand up to Darkseid?

5. I thought the Green Lantern rings were programmed to find a new host regardless of the state of the corps/the lantern? Isn't that how we had Kyle Rayner after Hal killed everyone back in the 90s? Shouldn't we see someone get John's ring which had clearly survived the magma incinerating everything?

6. If Darkseid brainwashed Batman, why didn't he know about Constantine being their backup plan? Wouldn't Batman say something like ""hey man, i know you're confident but maybe lets not send superman back and also lets put a self destruct chip in all the characters we're turning into cyborgs just in case?""

7. Why would Darkseid leave Luthod alive? He doesn't need him.

8. It might only be a thing in Arrow, but can't Constantine retrieve souls from hell? Why couldn't he fix Nightwing?

9. Isn't Shazam about on the same level as Superman? Why could the Paradooms rip him apart but not Superman?

10. That was the Mobius Chair Batman was on, right? Doesn't that mean he's omniscient? Once again how could any of this plot happen if Darkseid has that kind of power?

11. Why did Martian Manhunter have spider legs? He's a shapeshifter, he can just regrow his limbs! We even see him do it in the movie!

12. Speaking of Darkseid's Furies, Starfire died on earth. Does that mean they went all the way to earth to get her to make her a fury? Also why Starfire?

13. We just saw that Raven can revive people if there's a corpse. Is there a time limit on that, or could she have just revived everyone who died?

14. This is the DCU, right? They've got some pretty fast people left alive, and we've seen from the GL Corps that sentient life exists outside of earth. If the earth was going to become uninhabitable couldn't they build some big ships and take the remaining people of earth with them to find a new planet to inhabit?",DCcomics

gfvr9b,Battle of Batman Main Rouges!!!,"So let's write out a scenario for all main bat rouges to fight against each other who would win? I would say some will fall very fast and the ones who will need to put up the best they can by bringing in their advantages, ability's and disadvantages to defeat each other will be: Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, The Mad Hatter, The Joker, Bane, Killercroc, Deathstroke and Firefly, Edit: Manbat

Also in there were: Hugo Strange, Twoface, Blackmask, The Penguin, Ras'al Ghoul, Harley Quin, Catwomen, Deadshot, The Riddler and Professor Pyg. 

To explain the battle takes place in a territory where nobody has any advantage over anyone. No hidden places or much higher positions. It's just about the raw abilitys and tools/gimmics of each character.

The rouges I listed as also in there are rather dead at this point or unable to battle. 

So it's between all the villains I listed first, quite a problem there is that it is unclear what effects the special ability's of them would have on each other (Hypnosis, Pheromones, Gases ect)

And please respect the choices and just think it through. I'm open for every edit to bring another character up or down. I'm very thrilled who will win.",DCcomics

fwf2wj,"When it comes to Comic Book films or TV adaptations, should the director make his own vision or Listen to the fans?","Every one has their own way on how they want their favorite work to be adapted but if you know how Hollywood, the Internet, the general audience and hardcore fans work, its a lot more complicated than that. But two most popular opinions when it comes to adaptations is either let the director do what he wants with the property or directors should listen to the fans and serve them what they want. Now I know many will easily in the comments will easily say ""Why not both"" but if you know how filmaking works, that can sometime be impossible. Movies (especially genres like superhero movies) are quite expensive to make and studios want appeal too as many fans as possible. The MCU is doing a fantastic job appealing to the masses with amazing success but it gets a lot of criticism from filmbuffs and few comic book fans for playing it too safe without much unique visions in each films. But then you have films like Joker which is completely deviates from it's source materials and was a financial and critical success but got a lot of backlash from comic fans for again deviating from the source material. So in your opinion want do you want from a comic book movie adaptation? And not just superheroes but any comic book genre

In my opinion, I always say that directors should be free t make the adaptation with their vision as long as they understand the source material, not necessarily respect it. Their is this claim that producers and directors should respect the source material but I disagree to some degree. There a lot of movie adaptations that were made by filmmakers who weren't necessarily fans of the original source material but understood it and wanted to use the work to tell their own story. Movies Like Jurassic Park, Dredd (2012) , Starship Troppers are examples of this, one of the biggest example I know is Nicholas Meyer who wasn't a fan of star trek but used the universe and it's characters to tell the story he wanted to tell and in doing so he ended making the most beloved Star Trek film to date, ""The Wrath of Khan"". Hell even Keving feige wasn't a huge comic fan as he said in his Ama, and that he was more into things such as Star Wars, yet he is the producer of one of the biggest Movie Franshise in History based on said comic properties. That's cause they are able to chose what works and doesn't work for the big screen.  

As a hardcore comic book fan, I acknowledge that there are some things that just don't work for the big screen. Many say a comic book adaptation should be a beat by beat faithful adaptation but there is a reason why no comic book movie to this day has a title like that because certain things are just to grand and may I say, ridiculous that the general audience and even some comic fans will be left scratching their heads or thinking ""WTF!?"". I know genres like superheroes are known for it's ridiculousness and Insanity but not a lot of professional filmmakers are willing to embrace it and they do they do, they could end up turning off the GA who are an important audience for these movies as well as hardcore or casual fans.

Now do the alternative is of course animation like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse where the filmmaker can embrace the source material to the fullest as much as they want. I absolutely approve of this as I'm also an huge fan animation and feel it doesn't get the respect it deserves in the film world and the public. I've always felt characters Superman work better in animation after seeing the old Max Fleischer animated shorts, but sadly animation is too expensive, too niche, and not every charter is as popular as Batman or Spider-Man to get a well animated big screen adaption and still rake in the box office Bread.

In summary, Comic Books and film are two different mediums. Some elements just don't mix with the other which is why filmmakers should have free reign as long as they fully understand what they are adapting.",DCcomics

fenqli,[Discussion] What's your ranking of the DCEU films so far?,"So far, there have been eight entries in the DCEU. Some were really good while others were just either weak or bad. It‚Äôs finally great to see DC create their own cinematic universe. So here is my own personal ranking of the movies in the DC Extended Universe so far: 

8.) **Suicide Squad ‚Äì 2/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/hqtrrejoi5l41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c8c3965bf94a23f5e4b4255657227a5e03136cf

I just really hate this movie. Most of the jokes didn‚Äôt land, Will Smith was just playing himself, not Deadshot, Killer Croc looked terrible and just in general, the characters that weren‚Äôt Harley or Deadshot were underdeveloped. I thought Captain Boomerang was enjoyable, which only made me more disappointed that he wasn‚Äôt used more. Honestly, I loved Harley the most in this movie. She was fun. Amanda Waller was also a way better villain than Enchantress, who was a terrible villain in my opinion. I really wish they would‚Äôve made Joker the main antagonist instead to keep the story more grounded. Introduce magic through someone like Doctor Fate or something. Along with that, Joker was terrible. The tattoos looked dumb and aside from the fact there wasn‚Äôt enough of Joker, his laugh was also just terrible. Which really sucks because Leto HAS potential to be an awesome Joker! And you want to know what really pisses me off? David Ayer, the director, said the horrible theatrical cut WAS his cut. So when we got the extended edition, there were STILL a lot of cut scenes that made the movie remain terrible! I seriously can‚Äôt with this movie. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the reason this movie doesn‚Äôt have a full zero is because of the couple of fun scenes but overall, this movie is just a bad movie. 

7.) **Justice League ‚Äì 4/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/v4lwca1qi5l41.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a1c225344b8849c9b5f2b81855a05fa5190526

This was the movie I‚Äôve been dying to see for years. And honestly, I still hope that we will one day see the Snyder Cut. Joss Wheadon just completely destroyed the movie by trying to make it more like the Avengers with all the forced humor and terrible colors. So why isn‚Äôt this movie worse than Suicide Squad? Well, as bad as this movie is, I still have a soft spot for it. I was just happy to see my favourite heroes standing side-by-side together on the big screen. Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman and the Flash! Also, the chemistry between the characters was done well, except a few moments which were obviously from Joss. Sadly, this movie still has a lot of bad that outweigh the good. Batman is made into a joke in this movie, Steppenwolf is extremely dull, saying all the most generic villain lines we‚Äôve heard a million times, the color scheme is bad in the final act, Superman with a CGI mouth (Still gives me nightmares) and I don‚Äôt see the point with the family. This movie had so much potential but ultimately disappointed me. 

6.) **Birds of Prey ‚Äì 6/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/bip4susqi5l41.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc21a22e12fc629911b020617e649c83b5903cca

As a Birds of Prey movie, it‚Äôs not good. As a Harley Quinn movie, it‚Äôs really good. Honestly, I just blame the title at this point. If it was just a Harley Quinn movie, then this movie would probably get a higher score. Harley Quinn is at her absolute best in this movie and may even become the Deadpool of the DCEU since she breaks the fourth wall a couple of times. She was just so much fun to watch. Black Mask was also such a fun villain! One thing I really loved was how grounded this movie was compared to Suicide Squad. In SS, it had a cosmic magic villain fighting a group of misfit criminals. Here, it‚Äôs street-tier characters against a more grounded villain. I only wish the rest of the characters were better developed. Huntress had it worse. Her arc sounded very interesting but she gets cast in the background the most. I also wish they would‚Äôve showcased Black Canary‚Äôs powers more. Just in general, the actual Birds of Prey don‚Äôt get as much focus as Harley Quinn. One thing I‚Äôm glad for is seeing an accurate representation of Harley and Joker‚Äôs relationship. In a way, it seems they may be slowly fixing Suicide Squad‚Äôs mistakes. 

5.) **Wonder Woman ‚Äì 7/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/rvs0b4eri5l41.jpg?width=1365&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dea5c3b9f8816dc37ddc361993622fe5a57dc798

Powerful first and second act but terrible third and final act. This movie did a phenomenal job at developing Diana as a character. I also loved Steve Trevor too. Themyscira looked beautiful and the cinematography was just pure art. The action was epic and the score was amazing. In the first and second act, it was just very well written. I thought Ludendorff was a really great villain. Sadly, as great as the first and second act were, the third act was just so terrible. It had so much CGI that I actually felt nauseous and they completely disregarded the message a couple of seconds ago when Ares revealed himself. And along with that, Ares looked NOTHING like the God of War! He was short and a joke. Even when he enters his epic looking armor, you can STILL see his mustache!!! He wasn‚Äôt intimidating at all. As for the message, it showed how humanity will always destroy themselves with war. Then when Ares shows up, it turns out that nah, he is the true cause. Yeah, I just can‚Äôt with that final act. But as for the first and second, they were the best. 

4.) **Man of Steel ‚Äì 8/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/jgn9qi5si5l41.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b211a205bc1d1c88c734ed385d8e05194f7a37

I won‚Äôt lie, when I first saw this movie, I didn‚Äôt like it much. I thought it was way too dark for a Superman movie. This was because I was fourteen at the time and was still more used to the lighthearted Christopher Reeve version. As I got older, I came to appreciate the movie a lot more. Superman, to me, was always seen as this god that could basically do whatever he wanted but was also good. This movie humanized Superman in a very strong way. Also, let‚Äôs not ignore that epic soundtrack. Flight is still my favourite DCEU track. Everytime I hear it when I watch Man of Steel in the beginning, I get serious chills. Zod is an amazing villain and the action was just very well done. Honestly, the only negatives I had with this is the 

3.) **Aquaman ‚Äì 9/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/o592x4wsi5l41.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da90f44dcfeeda158d793579994ea01adba770de

Aquaman isn‚Äôt a superhero movie. Instead, it is a fantasy movie that just so happens to feature a superhero. The world of Atlantis is beautiful to look at, the movie does a great job at developing Arthur Curry as Aquaman and the villains, Black Manta and Ocean Master, are just so awesome! Sure, sometimes the writing could be a little confusing but as a whole, this movie is just amazing. I seriously can‚Äôt wait for the sequel.  

2.) **Shazam ‚Äì 10/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/8jvqvupti5l41.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ea57f08d42132ac986f54ea4200f46b9a8ee79a

This movie is basically a perfect superhero movie for me. It is an amazing coming-of-age story of a boy becoming a man. Literally and figuratively. What else is there to say that hasn‚Äôt already been said about this movie? It‚Äôs just really that great! Sometimes it could get dark to remind us this is DC and as a whole, it uses humor when it is just right. The characters are all very believable. Doctor Sivana is easily one of the best villains in the DCEU. I hope to see more of him in the future and especially can‚Äôt wait to see Shazam fight Black Adam!

1.) **Batman vs Superman ‚Äì 10/10** 

https://preview.redd.it/6xpg57cui5l41.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf0c5aae6f1ca91686797b7b0db476066632532

This movie is just very special to me. And bear in mind, I‚Äôm talking about the Ultimate Edition, not the bad theatrical cut. This movie gave us the best Batman I could ever ask for. He was a real detective in this and the action scenes, especially the warehouse scene, were one of the best superhero scenes I‚Äôve ever seen. Superman is once again humanized in a way that makes him relatable. People complain that he doesn‚Äôt smile much but can you really smile when the whole world either hates you or looks at you as a god? That‚Äôs a LOT of weight! Both Batman and Superman had valid reasons for fighting each other. Superman seeing Batman as this rogue vigilante who terrorized Gotham and Batman seeing Superman as this dangerous threat that needs to be dealt with immediately. Lex Luthor was a great villain. Yes, he isn‚Äôt the suave, slow-talking businessman we know from the DCAU, but as his own villain, he wasn‚Äôt that bad either. He was smart, manipulative and just completely insane. How he pulled the strings throughout the whole movie, all while setting up the next film was done brilliantly. The cinematography, the setting up for the cinematic universe with Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League and the freaking soundtrack, this movie truly is art. It may get a lot of hate, but I don‚Äôt care. This is still my favourite entry in the DC Extended Universe. Let‚Äôs not forget about the fact that this was the first time in history we got to see Batman and Superman together in live action on the big screen! Two of the most iconic superheroes together.

Usually, he's only second to the Joker as Batman's greatest villain and a contender for archenemy. In terms of scope, it seems he's considered even more dangerous than Joker since his plans affect the entire world. 

Yet when I think of Batman, I tend to think of the more colorful villains and odd villains like Joker, Catwoman, Riddler, Penguin, and Two Face. Ra's Al Ghul does  have prominence in TAS and the Dark Knight Trilogy but I'm wondering when he started establishing his reputation as one of, if not",DCcomics

ff56ia,Opinion: The Wrap is the worst pop culture website ever,"So I recently read this article that ranked every DC comics movie and I have to say it is one of the worst lists I have ever read. I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but the things it says about the movies sound stupid to me. The article I‚Äôm talking about is called Every DC Comics Movie Ranked From Worst to Best, Including ‚ÄòBirds of Prey‚Äô and ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô",DCcomics
ff59i2,"I‚Äôve just finished Mutiversity: Pax Americana, and WOW","I‚Äôve started reading Multiversity after buying the deluxe edition. I‚Äôve found it solid and good, until this chapter. It really made the quality skyrocket. I am going to make a comment of every aspect I loved and it will be spoilery. I hope someone will enjoy the passion I‚Äôll put in this love letter to the chapter like I enjoyed reading the story and writing about it.

The plot, once you have understood it and rearranged chronologically, seems pretty plain and not that complex. I must disagree with this thought seeing how solid it is in the complexity of the whole Multiversity narration. It looks like a banal thing to say but under all the high level narration and illustration this aspect could easily go underrated.

Of course I bet is plenty of people who analyzed the illustration and its symbolism, starting from the use of the color to highlight when something happened and why it happened in that moment, concluding with the eight-parted structure of the pages. I don‚Äôt think I am saying anything new to anyone, but I really enjoyed understanding all the graphical quality of the story, all the effort putted for recreating the eight or the peace symbol every few pages, the Z structure, the big ‚Äúhole‚Äù of the bridge that is the hole of the plan described in that page and not only that, the genially constructed pages of Nora‚Äôs murder. And have I mentioned the use of color? Shees it is one of my favorite things ever.

The narration isn‚Äôt just complex to be complex, and I bet anyone had understood that. I think that it‚Äôs pretty obvious how the way it is crafted and the order of the event narrated is all to represent the algorithm 8, but I think that this isn‚Äôt the unique lecture you can give. It isn‚Äôt just a puzzle. You don‚Äôt have all the pieces shuffled randomly and all you need to do is rearrange them to have the full picture. There is a reason behind that specific order. Not only thematically, but also it‚Äôs a matter of interpretation. The subsequent event described serves as an interpretation not of the events described in the previous page, but of the meaning of those events. Even if the two events aren‚Äôt chronologically linked, even if they are parte of two different sections of the puzzle. You don‚Äôt have to simply understand what happened, and that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have a chronological order with one event causing or being caused from another. The different characters speak between them all across the timeline. Something happened 5 years prior finishes a sentence from 5 years later. Interpretation.",DCcomics

How the hell can Marvel release a damn KULL OMNIBUS while DC cancels one of the most awaited omnis ever which is Man of Steel by Byrne? What is wrong with the new ugly paper? Why are they releasing standard size hardcovers first of series like Morrison's Green Lantern just to bump the price and not even make the artwork bigger? WHY did they cancel Animal Man vol. 2 deluxe? Why are cult classic series that would sell something like Milligan's Shade the Changing Man uncollected in anything except original issues and one or two first story arcs?? Why do they have to recolor CLASSICS like Swamp Thing in the Absolute format? Why is the Omnibus binding so shitty that it doesn't stay open and you get so much gutter loss? I'm never buying a DC book again until they stop treating their customers right. Add to that closing down Vertigo and I have no idea why they are still in the business. Such a terrible company.,DCcomics

After Grant Morrison got his hands on them, he had a pretty unique idea.  A team of heroes who never met each other but came together to stop an alien threat.  These heroes were just as obscure (maybe a little less, maybe a but more) and were super diverse and cool.  They were a New Shining Knight, the Manhattan Guardian, Zatanna, Klarion the Witch Boy, Mister Miracle Shilo Norman, Bulleteer and Frankenstein (yes that one).

This would probably be on DC Universe like Titans, Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn.

&amp;#x200B;

You could actually go multiple ways with this.  It could be a direct adaptation with a few changes (Manhattan Guardians origin might need a rework considering the current political climate, Mister Miracle aswell for non political reasons more just of how complex it is and how it was essentially a set up for Final Crisis), it could be an anthology per season with a new seven every season and a new threat.  Or it could be an animated show that sticks closer.  Honestly it could be adapted pretty easily with very little actual CGI necessary (apart from the Zatanna and Mister Miracle sections).

In the Rebirth continuity, Justice League Dark establishes that The Wizard is one of the 7 wizards of the Council/Circle of Eternity who learnt magic at the Rock of Eternity. That's fine. It could have still happened 9000 years ago too. Still fits.

In one of the Shazam books he said he's from Khandaq. A fictional country in Africa. That's fine. Canaan could be in Khandaq, or just replace one location for the other. Still fits.

But in one of the Shazam books he also said his name is Mamaragan. This makes no sense. Mamaragan is an aboriginal god. The Wizard isn't a god and he isn't Australian. So maybe he just used that as a title, and/or maybe worshipers mistook him for Mamaragan? It doesn't really fit with everything else.

For now my headcanon is that he's Jebediah and he's from Khandaq. Then 9000 years ago, he and 6 other wizards from around the world discovered the Rock of Eternity and learnt magic there. Calling themselves the Council of Eternity. Or the Circle of Eternity. Whichever it is at the moment.",DCcomics

Especially post city of bane I felt Batman is in a very vulnerable place and would be desperate to get one of his most trusted friends and ally‚Äôs back. I had this whole senecio in my head that after Alfred‚Äôs death Batman is desperate to find nightwing so they can both mourn the loss of the man that practically raised then both, that he had stopped going on patrol and spends all day on the bat computer searching the world for nightwing who can‚Äôt be found bc he‚Äôs become a talon for the courts. They coulda had nightwing attempt to assassinate some other dc character. I was thinking they could do Garth( Aqualad) being the Atlantis diplomat to the surface world and talon ric attacks him taking out his guards and injuring Garth, that would lead Aquaman to being a video of the attack to Batman because of his experiences with the court of owls in the past. And after studying the video for hours Batman finally figured out nightwing is the talon and is brainwashed by the court. The comic coulda had some epic last page too of Selina coming down to the cave to check on Bruce only to find the cave in a mess with the chair through the giant monitor screen( think BTAS bat computer) and when she calls out Bruce‚Äôs name he‚Äôll step out of the shadows in some badass bat suit we haven‚Äôt seen before decked out to fight through an army of the reanimated corpses of the talons to bring nightwing back.

They try  help him get back to his earth but whilst they are trying they find out the cause of his teleportation (stuff surrounding 5G), they eventually both get a talk with him in private both being inspired by the old red robin with Ric returning to his nightwing/Dick identity and Tim using the Red Robin costume. 
The reason I really want a story like this is that reading kingdom come dick never got to really shine and it would have been so cool to have him confront Bruce or see why he chose the Red Robin mantle.

ek5jhc,[UPDATE] Idea for a Crisis event,"The Antagonist:
For the villain of this crisis he had to special, so I thought ‚Äúwhat if someone found out they were unwillingly ripped from their lives and gets knowledge on all of the DC Universe‚Äù. I‚Äôm thinking the name ‚ÄúThe Remembrance‚Äù He knows everything, about everyone, even more than Batman. His motives are he remembers flashpoint and the pre 52, the world changed for him, he never met his wife, his mother died and his career ended early with fake allegations. He was then hit with speed force energy when the blue flash arrives in ‚ÄúOut Of Time‚Äù , he remembers everything and gains new knowledge of everything. He is then accidentally to the ‚ÄúEarth U‚Äù, an earth of silver age heroes. He then carries out a massacre of that earth and the rest is history.

The Story:

The Crisis event begins as a noir mystery, the mystery being that Batman has been shot dead, no one knows who killed him as The Flash investigates, it is discovered a multiversal villain has been singlehandedly killing universes, torturing their heroes out of vengeance, the Crisis then begins when the villain, named [Comment name]  singlehandedly takes down every Justice League member one by one, until finally he captures a weakened Superman and places him in the god machine, a multiversal warship that uses kryptonians as overcharged solar panels. He then captures earth 1, as the remaining heroes are cornered, they are saved by none other than Batman who leads them out of earth. 

It is revealed Batman has been plucked out of time by Doctor Fate so he can help with the Crisis, but he must return to the exact second he dies when it is over. Batman says that they must gather reinforcements, as they say this, the JLA of Earth 2 arrive with other reality heroes, revealing that the Remembrance has captured thousands of earths. The groups set out to recruit heroes to join in the fight against the Remembrance . The Flash stays behind to gather local reinforcements. 

The first hero they recruit is the Batman Of War, the only survivor when The Remembrance slaughtered the JLA 3 years prior and forced Batman to inadvertently kill a bus full of children, watch his entire family die and kill a army of parademons, some say he fought nonstop for 2 days. He has become a violent murderous Batman, still wearing his bloody Batsuit. He is nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Omen Of Crisis‚Äù",DCcomics

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to [hide spoilers](#spoiler) when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

So my question is
Which events are the important ones? ((ie flashpoint, the crises) but what about the button, doomsday clock, court of owls, death of the family etc))

ekn4l6,"Joaquin Phoenix was a bad Joker, Jared Leto was better.","I don't understand the hype around the Joker Film or people praising Joaquin Phoenix.

Visually he doesn't look the part. The Joker in the comics and cartoons is tall, sometiems the very least normal height. But Joaquin Phoenix is a 5'6 Manlet. His height is listed 5'8 online, but he's actually 5'6. People online say he's much shorter in person, and if you see pictures of him, he tends to look short next to other celebrities. If someone is going to play Joker they shouldn't be a man-midget. It's the same reason I didn't like Mark Ruffalo playing Bruce Banner, Bruce is supposed to be normal height and Mark Ruffalo is 5'6.

He also has a cleft lip but the Joker doesn't have a cleft lip. It looks distracting when watching the joker and seeing that noticeable cleft lip scar.

Also his acting as bad and overrated. He either overacts too much or doesn't act enough. And when he started dancing on the stairs, it came off as way too silly for a supposedly serious movie. Joaquin Phoenix takes himself way too seriously like he's constantly trying to act deep and artsy.

I didn't feel like I was watching the Joker, I felt I was just watching a depressed person becoming crazy and take it out on the world for the laughs. If I just wanted to watch a movie about a depressed crazy person I would have just watched something else.

Most people seem to love Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, but I didn't like him. I honestly think they should have used another actor. One that's taller and more talented. Honestly, Jared Leto looked better as the joker than Joaquin. Jared was taller, didn't have a cleft lip, and acted better. Also, there is nothing wrong with his tattoos, his look is more modern. People who hate Jared Leto tattoos for being different are hypocrites because they seem to be completely fine with Joaquin Phoenix blue eye makeup and red eyebrows. Ironically enough the people who hate Jared Leto's tattoos for looking too edgy are edgy themselves with ""Society is horrible"" Joker.",DCcomics

e69ab6,"No matter what, I just can't get over the fact that Tim Drake now calls himself... ""Drake""","It's utterly horrible and a disgrace to this character.   
For batsy's former two prot√©g√©s, changing and outgrowing their name from ""Robin"" to a new one meant something deeply personal and achieving a next higher level, reaching maturity, independence and representing themselves.   
Dick got inspired by an old tale form Superman's home planet and wanted to step out of his mentor's shadow and Jason decided to take on the former name of the man who killed him. No matter what, THIS was something that linked Jason forever and ever with the Joker moving forward.   
And with Tim? He simply happened to meet (one of) his evil incarnation(s) who called himself ""Drake"" and he thought ""wow, that sounds cool!"" - it's just unoriginal and MEANINGLESS. It was just a desperate way to give him a new name tag in one of the most unspectacular ways imaginable.   
I acknowledge the fact that ""Red Robin"" wasn't a name good enough to really sequester himself from the ""Robin""-title since Damian came into being but calling him simply by a male duck just doesn't seem right.  


Not to mention that ""Drake"" is the WORST POSSIBLE name for someone whose last name is literally... DRAKE! That doesn't suit Tim's persona at all with his extraordinary detectival skills and high intelligence.   


It's just BAD. The only little consolation is his new suit, I don't mind it that much.

e6ecg1,My pitch for a Joker sequel. What do you guys think?,"

What about a sequel that treats itself and the first one as one of many possible origins for the joker. The sequel is a Goodfellas-type mob/gangster crime film that involves Jack Napier working for Carmine Falcone as a money launderer. The film details his movement up the ranks in the crime family until he betrays the Falcone Crime Family, angered due to the lack of respect towards him as well as the death of his pregnant wife due to a shootout between Falcone‚Äôs men and Marino‚Äôs men. He joins the violent Red Hood gang as their leader, stealing all the money meant to go to Falcone for himself.

The third act takes place in Ace Chemicals as he carries out a heist  until he is ambushed by Falcone and his men, trying to kill Jack and the rest of the red hood gang, until a shadow creature appears and Falcone flees.

The rest of the gang vanishes, seemingly killed, until a confrontation between this terrifying creature and Jack takes place over a vat of chemicals. Jack accidentally falls in, and we then cut to Falcone‚Äôs men finding all of Napier‚Äôs belongings and the money he laundered. We cut back to Napier climbing out of a pipe onto the street. The classic comic book panel is mirrored, with Napier‚Äôs appearance very similar to [this](https://i.redd.it/kyg0dehb5b241.jpg). He goes on a killing rampage as he reaches insanity, killing many innocent people

Napier returns as The Joker, hunting down and killing many of Falcone‚Äôs men. Soon these men begin to work for Napier, and they rob a large stash of Falcone‚Äôs money. As the film wraps up with Falcone disgruntled by the loss of his men and his money, The Joker skips gleefully through a chaotic and violent standoff between his men and police. As a whimsical circus theme plays, he is crowned the true Clown Prince of Crime.",DCcomics

2. Showcasing his intelligence and detective skills by analyzing and breaking down suspects and crime scenes in an original way that doesn't just feel like a ripoff of Sherlock Holmes (Cumberbatch and RDJ), working in a crime lab and solving problems.
3. Showing him as a lithe and fluid fighter, instead of just a heavy bruiser. Showcase his fighting and stealth skills. 
4. Build the BatCat relationship, don't just end it after 1 movie. Set up the world enough that leaves room to explore this world further, and that they can grow and evolve together along the way.
5. Breaking down just what ""the mission"" truly means to batman, including his ""do not kill"" rule. Have him tested and conflicted with trying to uphold what some would view as a childish ideal in a situation and world that may not find it feasible.
6. A storyline that doesn't have Batman basically just being a reactive participant in the story. In most films he just gets involved when something bad happens, or villians are trying to punish/kill him.",DCcomics

It was a short lived series created by Bruce Timm around 2012, and it is one of the best cartoon Green Lantern adaptations out there. Imagine if those blocky, large-chested super heroes from Justice League and Justice League Unlimited were put into 3D CGI form. 

Along with the action you would assume would be in a kids cartoon from DC, there is a surprisingly heartfelt second season &gt;!with the near destruction of the entire universe because of a love story!&lt;. The characters of Hal Jordan, Kilowog, Aya, and the Red Lantern Razer are all surprisingly deep and three-dimensional. This series also introduced me to all the other lantern corps that I never new about, from the Orange Lanterns of Greed to the Star Sapphires of Love.

\&gt;!Season 1 was your general good vs bad type of cartoon, having the Green Lantern Corps fighting the Red Lantern Corps. Season 2 is much better, in my opinion, due to the plot being directly caused by the heroes mistakes, and the climax of the love story between Aya and Razer. This type of story is much better than a lot of the slog that modern cartoons are made of!&lt;. 

I give this cartoon the same praise we all do with seasons 1 and 2 of Young Justice and the classic Teen Titans. And if that doesn't convince you to at least give the series a try, I don't know what will. 

It is honestly a shame that the series had to end in a cliffhanger because toy sales didn't do very well. I blame the Green Lantern movie that came out around the same time. I'm not expecting there to ever be some sort of revitalization of the show like what happened with Young Justice, but I thought I'd just put the word out about a fantastic DC show that sadly ended before it's time should've been up.",DCcomics

drh9zs,"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [November 4, 2019]","Hey there honorary Justice League members - it‚Äôs a new week which means it‚Äôs time for a new discussion thread!

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week‚Äôs releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Green Lantern* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Green Lantern"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Anyone caught posting unwarranted top level comments will be flaired and publicly shamed.  

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Christopher Priest has been doing a great job with *Deathstork*, and I'm excited to see him write an encounter against Duck Grayson and Batmallard!""

drhogo,Batman Knightfall - it is worth reading?,"So I'm a big Batman fan, and have collected Batman #404 - #480 or so, just before the Knightfall preludes. I've heard that Knightfall itself is great, but Knightquest and Knightsend are a little lacklustre, the Jean-Paul Valley stuff in particular. But I don't want to just stop with Batman having his back broken and not have a resolve!

Would the story make sense if I cut out the Knightquest tpb, and just skipped straight to Knightsend (where I assume bruce makes his return)?

Thanks",DCcomics
drhytf,Pitch An Idea For B-List or Lower Characters,"Basically pitch ideas for a character(s) that doesn't get much use and/or is not very popular. It can either be a story direction, origin alteration, an elseworld etc.

My ideas:

Lorena Marquez, Koryak, Miya Shamada and Neptune Perkins - Lorena is the second Aquagirl, Koryak is Aquaman's illegitimate son from pre-flashpoint and Miya and Neptune are water-based metahumans. I'd reimagine them all as a team of Atlantian-human hybrids who are lead by Jackson Hyde (Kaldur) and who serve as Atlantian representatives to the surface world while Arthur deals with Atlantian politics below the sea.

Xiang Po (Gloss) - A Chinese woman who was a member of the 80s New Guardians team. I'd rewrite her as a mortal who was made a demigod by the Chinese goddess Nuwa and given the power over Earth.

Nubia - She will be Philippus' daughter and would be taken prisoner in a war with demons from another realm. Returning to Themyscira she will deal with PTSD and a changing world.",DCcomics

drmlb5,People's problems with DC's Current Animated Movies,"It seems like a lot of people don't know the difference between Art &amp; Animation because seeing a Still Image or a Shot from any of the movies is considered the Art, while the Animation is the movement of the Image/Shot on screen. It is impossible to judge how good the animation will be just by looking at the art because if you watch Japaneses animations (or Anime), you know that there are some them that have good art and subpar animation (.i.e.Early Dragon Ball Super) or subpar art and excellent animation (.i.e.Mob Psycho 100). So my point is, the current DC Animated movies are not perfect and, in my opinion although the Art Style is different, it is just as good as the previous justice league cartoons and when the animation truly shines ( fight scenes in Death of Superman, Batman v Robin, etc) it is superior to even the best from the STAS, JLU and even BTAS. I think people focus the vast majority of their attention on the negative aspects (which I understand to a certain extent) but it's almost as if they're oblivious to any good that comes out of them. There's nothing wrong with disliking them but there are a lot of people that look down on them like garbage while upholding JLU, BTAS, STAS, etc to a near perfection status and ignoring the wealthy of problems those ones also had (which is probably fueled by nostalgia to a certain extent) because at the core, the current animated movies and the previous series/movies are not so different

Of course all this is my opinion and you're free to disagree but at least try and give explanations for your reasoning.",DCcomics

drtxj6,Idea for a JLDark Team and Story,"Let's start with the characters for the team.

Doctor Occult: DC's First Superhero, he's an old school detective who specializes in investigating the supernatural. 

Kid Eternity: A kid that has the power to summon any spirt to his aid, though only for sixty seconds.

Fadeaway Man: A villain who studied the occult and history, but ultimately his power lies in his cloak which allows him to teleport and become invisible

Madame Zodiac: A fortune teller with split personalities. One that is evil and uses black magic while the other is good and uses white magic. 

Baron Winters: He helps maintain the order of good and evil, never getting involved himself but does recruit others to get involved. 

-

Alright, the threat of this story would be that Heaven and Hell are ready to go to war with each other over Timothy Hunter, a kid who was born as a conduit for raw magic. 

Of course it starts out as a slow burn, with Doctor Occult investigating a mysterious death of an Angel before being attacked and saved by Baron Winters who pulls him into his home.

It would be there where the others are already gathered and after a meeting they'd head out to try to find out what's going on.

In any case some characters that would appear would be Zauriel, Lady Blaze, Captain Scumm, Asmodel and the Pax Dei.",DCcomics

dczfzl,[Discussion] What do you think of a more dynamic comic world?,"To preface all this I love the stories that DC have made, stories about Hal Jordan and Superman and Batman but one thing that has kind of bugged me in the limited time I've been reading comics is that nothing really changes. Everything more or less moves back to the status quo true we have minor tweaks like new characters, characters taking up new roles etc. but the big picture more or less stays the same. Bruce Wayne has been a 30 year old crime fighter in a batsuit for decades same goes for superman and wonder woman. And I get why they do this, these characters are iconic and at the end of the day it *is* a business.   


But in my perfect world we'd see heroes age with us I'd like to live in a world where Barry dies of old age and Wally takes up the mantle then wally retires only for Wallace to take it then Bart then who knows what. I'd like to read comics where Superman's name is Jon Kent and that's normal. I can totally see both sides of the argument though and I guess this is why I like Young Justice so much since they're experimenting with these ideas with the characters we all love its also why I like the MCU because since the characters are tied to actors who do age they can't revert everything back to the status quo by use of the sliding time scale. It'll also open things up from a storytelling standpoint as much as I love modern day comics they do get a little repetitive and the only way to break out of the cycle is to constantly get bigger and bigger until the scope of the story is so large it loses meaning on the small scale.   


Once again this is just my opinion and I can totally see it from other points of view I'm just curious what you guys think.",DCcomics

dd4iu4,Superman is also a great Embodiment of Great power and responsibility.,A cool aspect that I like about Superman when related to Spider-Man they have one thing in common With Great Power there must come great responsibility. Those characters are both shaped and molded by there parents into who they are as people. We also know that if you removed Uncle Ben or The Kent‚Äôs those characters would‚Äôve been drastically different. But Superman lives by that motto he has these powers and chooses to be responsible with them because of his good upbringing with his parents. In Superman for tomorrow he says he saves people because he can and because his father saved him so he pays it forward to save people but he ultimately would‚Äôve never came to that conclusion about saving people and being responsible about his powers without his parents influence on teaching him good values. It‚Äôs a great way to fold Jor-el into his Great Power motivation.

dd84oh,Who are your Top 10 favourite DC Villains?,"While DC Comics definitely has amazing superheroes, they also without a doubt have the best villains too! So here is my list of my ten personal favourite DC villains! 

***My Top 10 Favourite DC Villains:*** 

10.) **Bane** \- He has really grown on me over the last year. At first, I just thought of him as nothing more than an overrated brute but he has proven to be far more than that. He serves as a perfect rival to Batman on a physical level, while also on an intellectual level too. He is a tactical genius and already has fearsome raw strength. But when he adds his toxin, he becomes an absolute monster when he gets desperate. Also, he is most infamously recognized as the man who broke the Bat! 

9.) **The Batman Who Laughs** \- The newest addition to the DC villains slate! He is just so awesome! This is basically a Batman if the Joker wins. Or should I say a Batman/Joker fusion! With Batman's intelligence, prep time, gadgets and combat abilities, mixed with Joker's insanity and unpredictable nature, the Batman Who Laughs truly is a force to be reckoned with. Plus, he is so bad that Batman and the Joker literally had to team up in order to defeat him. Overall, he truly earned his place among my ten favourite DC villains! 

8.) **Lex Luthor** \- The perfect archenemy towards Superman and for sure a Justice League-level threat if he wants to be. Being a ruthless charismatic businessman, Luthor continues to try and find ways to either expose Superman as a monster so the world could hate him, or destroy the Big Blue Scout himself. Luthor is extremely cunning and always one step ahead of Superman. So despite the fact that Superman is practically a god compared to him, he still proves to best Superman in many ways, causing Superman to really think when facing Lex Luthor. 

7.) **Black Adam** \- Technically an antivillain but he still proves to be a ruthless rival towards Shazam. He has a good motive and an interesting backstory. Plus, I just love characters which have lightning as one of their powers! 

6.) **Reverse-Flash** \- Eobard Thawne is an insane psychopath who's only goal in life is to be the worst archenemy Barry has ever seen. He goes out of his way to make Barry's life miserable. Every negative thing that has happened in Barry's life was because of Thawne. Plus, he is connected to the negative speed-force. Overall, he is basically an evil version of what Barry is. If Barry used his speed for evil, that would be Thawne. 

5.) **Black Manta** \- I just love his arc a lot, and he is also a badass too! I love his rivalry with Aquaman so whenever I see a comic featuring Black Manta, I will try and get it as soon as possible. 

4.) **Darkseid** \- Evil incarnate. Honestly, I believe he is by far the most powerful DC villain (Since Trigon is defeated by children). He perfectly serves as the ultimate foil for the Justice League and pretty much the whole DC universe. He wants control over every living lifeform and is the most fearsome tyrant the universe has ever seen. His Omega Beams are powerful enough to erase you from existence and has strength that can reach insane levels. 

3.) **The Joker** \- Chaos incarnate. The Joker has no morals whatsoever and at the end of the day, he just wants to watch the world burn (And even THAT wouldn't be enough to satisfy his psychopathic tendancies)! He wants chaos for the sake of chaos and will not stop wrecking havoc. He is also very unpredictable so even despite having no physical powers, he can prove to be a fearsome foe that could be classified as a Justice League-level threat. His relationship with Batman is especially the highlight, as they're both two sides of the same coin and two threads in the same stitch. Archenemies for life.

2.) **Deathstroke** \- The most badass villain ever. Able to beat Batman in a fight and is even able to stand toe-to-toe against gods. This guy knows no limits. If the contract pays good, he will get the job done. I especially loved him in the original Teen Titans cartoon. Love him again in Titans! 

1.) **The Riddler** \- No matter what happens, I will always have a soft spot for Ed. He will always be my personal favourite DC villain. If he's in a story, I will definitely read it. He has an insane genius-level intellect and he dresses in style. Plus, green and purple are my favourite colors! 

So who are YOUR Top 10 favourite DC villains? :D",DCcomics

dd8l3t,[SPOILERS] Thoughts about Joker...,"I hesitate to call this a superhero or even a comic book movie. You could easily take the name Joker off the film and could sell it as a cohesive narrative. It‚Äôs essentially Taxi Driver meets The King of Comedy calling itself Joker so people will go see it. Phoenix is brilliant and the direction is spot on but there was something missing for me. I don‚Äôt think I got the amount of Joker that I wanted. There sure is a lot of beating the shit out of Arthur Fleck but he‚Äôs not Joker until he gives in at the end of the movie. I just think a man with that mindset is way more interesting than seeing a man get the snot kicked out of him. While what we got of Joker was great, I wanted more. And the death of the Waynes was really jammed in there for no reason. Batman just doesn‚Äôt work in this universe. Am I missing something that everyone else got from this? I thought it was good but I would still put TDK and even Batman Begins over it.",DCcomics

Quote from Mark Waid ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the story: I always wanted to tell the story of the moment Wally learns from Barry Allen he can travel through time. What I wanted to set up was a week before, one of his classmates is killed in a freak accident. So Wally seizes on this as an opportunity to go fix the past. So he goes back and he fails. And he goes back again and he fails. And he goes back again and he fails. And then you‚Äôve got a bunch of different Kid Flashes running around, stumbling over each other to try and fix this. He finally realizes, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fix this.‚Äù There are some things you can‚Äôt change. He accepts that, but he hates time travel after that.

\- Batman Vs Superman (Although the film is not great, Ben Affleck is a great Batman)

cz59s3,Good Bad Reporting. Lois and others.,"I see this trope all too often in comic book stories and I saw it again with Lois just now reading through the backlog of Action Comics so I thought I'd bring it up. 

Lex (this is back a few years ago when Lex is supposed to be a good guy) says Lois is a good reporter because she goes right for the jugular. 

Now this approach has some merit when you're ambushing someone at their home or place of business and catching their reaction on camera. But the most you're going to get is an exasperated reaction, rarely if ever are you going to get anything like a confession through this kind of approach. That's the best you're going to get when your subject isn't talking to the press.

But that's not the case here. Lois has a scheduled interview with Lex Luthor and Lex has agreed to talk. The approach you want to use when you've got your subject like that is to get them comfortable with you first, get them to answer some questions they'd be happy to answer and slowly transition into the harder the harder questions once there's a friendly atmosphere and the interview subject is already in the habit of answering your questions. Under those conditions people are often willing to reveal more about themselves than they normally would because they feel like they can trust you, often they'll reveal things they hadn't intended indirectly. They won't reveal everything but its rare you're going to get an interviewee to crack and spill his guts. 

So while ""hitting with the hard questions"" has its place in journalism its not best for every situation and its not best for the story where Lois Lane is using it that I'm currently reading. The writer is falling back on cliches.",DCcomics

Imagine if Spiderman was was only known for having the ability to talk to spiders. How popular would he be? Now take Aquaman being able to do literally everything aquatic creatures can, only scaled the fuck up. Aqualad being able to generate electricity like an eel in Young Justice only scratches the tip of the surface of what could have been. He could be like Beast Boy with the ability to every undersea creature's defense mechanisms at once with different parts of his body. Razor shark teeth and sandpaper skin to augment close combat, tentacle generation at will, lethally toxic pufferfish spike expulsion like from the whole body a fucking airbag if anybody tries to get cute with a rear naked choke. Instead you basically just get ""swim real good and hit hard with fists and shiny sea fork"". Such a waste. Give me a time machine and the Aquaman rights, I'll do right by ya boy",DCcomics

czdiqr,James Robinson made Jason of Themyscira into such a self-inserted fanfic character,"After reading Wonder Woman Rebirth , it made me remember of Jason of Themyscira and how his concept was wasted with James Robinson.

That writter not only pulls an absurd amount of power-ups to Jason , he pretty much treated him as some self-inserted character that up the own protagonist of that comic (Wonder Woman).

WW have standard powers (flight , strenght , stamina...) plus a little bit of elektrokinesis that she pretty much only uses to give an elemental stats to her attacks or that WW Movie skill of a radio blast when crossing her bracelets.

Meanwhile , he had her powers , aerokinesis , can turn into weather , can predict the future , is a good fighter and later on have Shazam powers....

The worst thing is that they could tweak the story a little bit , let alone his power-set and making him interesting.

Like making more scenes with him and Grail and letting Diana convince him more and more that his GF is actually crazy....shows him to not be a liability to Diana , but still not experienced like her , let alone they could tweak his powerset and armor to be far more interesting and balanced.

for example:

they could take away this whole weather transformation and density control , let alone alone elektrokinesis , so he would have physical attributes , aerokinesis and be a seer. With the armor , instead of be a Shazam ripoff , it could just overclock one of his natural powers for a limited time and making him tired afterword , they could even , in contrast to Diana receiving blessings from the gods , to make Jason cast a curse of the gods into his enemies , with drawback of forcing him to concentrate and , as such , be in danger in enemy crossfire.",DCcomics

cldoyg,Unlikely Leviathan Theory,"I posted this on another site just now, but thought I'd sign up for reddit real quick and post it here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with what I believe we know: 

1. Leviathan is one of the top tier detectives on the planet. We know this because he has every other detective and spy agency on wild goose chases pointing fingers at each other. The only way he could set it up so Amanda Waller, Lois Lane, Steve Trevor and pretty much every top authority figure in the spy game look like prime suspects to each other is if he/she knows how detectives think and is smart enough to manipulate the evidence. Leviathan does this to the point that Batman is fooled. So the real question is: Who is a better detective than Batman?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Whoever this is clearly knows Barbara Gordon and everything she has been through, and ultimately respects her.

&amp;#x200B;

3. No bodies. This isn't just a ""its because Leviathan is a superhero"" thing. Leviathan could have easily convinced him (or her) self that this was all for the greater good. You make a great Watchman argument in your Ted Kord theory, but remember that Ozy had no problem killing millions for the greater good. Leviathan is no Ozy, and believes whole heartedly in the ""no killing"" philosophy. This makes me believe that whoever Leviathan is, he or she is from the Bat Family. And with all the emphasis on Batman, Robin, and Jason, I really feel strongly that this is going to be one of those things that Batman feels responsible for. Call it anchor bias lol, but I really think this is a Bat Family thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Whoever Leviathan is knew about Talia Al Ghoul's Leviathan and usurped her eventually. So whoever this is had the ability to get close to her and snake her own organization out from under her.

&amp;#x200B;

So now let's put all those together and build a profile. 

1. GOAT Detective

2. Knows Barbara ""The Oracle"" Gordon at a personal level

3. Refuses to Kill / Possible Bat Family

4. Knows Talia's organization

&amp;#x200B;

Put all this together and you get Tim Drake. And when you start thinking Tim Drake, a lot of this makes too much sense. Remember that Tim was the architect behind Batman Incorporated, which was a global effort to do what he did in Gotham to an international level. In a sense, he was already striving for what Leviathan is doing all the way back when he started Batman Inc. 

Then he gets abducted and everyone thinks he's dead. Then he comes back, and outside of Young Justice, he's surprisingly out of the spotlight.  

And then the fact they show him going to Batgirl early is important to me. Out of everyone, why Batgirl? With Plastic Man, they say for certain that Plastic Man wasn't abducted. But no one has seen Barbara yet. That's why she has to know him really well. That was the best part of the Ted Kord theory to me, but it also makes good sense if its Tim. 

Superman says the blue energy blast seemed familiar. Tim could have learned of this tech from Dr. Oz's lair, who we would later find out is Sups dad. It could be why its alien enough to fool Batman, but still vaguely familiar to Superman. Hell, Dr. Oz's lair where he had Tim contained could be where Tim is keeping everyone. 

Tim would also be privy to all of Batman's intel on Talia and Leviathan, and would be smart enough to make Jason look like a prime suspect to throw people off. Remember, Leviathan just needs to wait until morning for his plan to go off. So having them chase Jason, who Tim knows will run away and will be hard to catch even for Batman, is actually pretty smart. And at the same time, while Bruce is putting together an A list of detectives together, how did he leave out the one person who solved his own secret? The best detective out of his list of prodigies? Its just odd that Tim isn't around helping to solve this.

 I like the Ted Kord theory, I do. I just don't think Ted or anyone in his circle can outsmart Batman, Waller, Trevor, and every spy agency on earth at the same time. The list of people smart enough to do that is small, but I would put Tim on that list.

And since Bendis let it be known that this is a huge Lois Lane story, I think that the end will come down to if Lois reports that it was Tim Drake or not. Reveal Tim, and possibly Batman's, secret identity to the world, or give up her ideals as a reporter?

&amp;#x200B;

So unless Young Justice was off in Gemworld during the whole Event Leviathan night, I think its Tim. If Young Justice was already ruled out, then ignore me! But yeah, Tim Drake.  Full of anchor bias? Heck yeah. But I'm sticking to my guns here.",DCcomics

clog3a,10 Ways Ric Grayson Could‚Äôve Been Better,"1. Just call him Dick, ‚ÄúRic‚Äù is completely unnecessary.

2. The arc should‚Äôve started out with him not knowing he was ever a superhero. Bruce should‚Äôve told him that at one point he was his ward, and was shot as collateral damage in a supervillain atack. This would lead up to a cool reveal of Dick finding out about his lost life.

3. Bruce, Barbara,  the rest of the Batfamily and Titans should‚Äôve had guest appearances in each issue. Not as their superhero identities, but as their true selves. Each character would be there to check up on Dick, and try to remind him of who he once was, outside of the superhero stuff. In each issue, draw the figure of Batman in the distance, watching his old partner. 

4. Change Dick‚Äôs personality completely. The hack writers made him a watered down Jason Todd, which is absolutely lazy. Make him insecure for not amounting to everyone‚Äôs expectations. Have him go down a spiral of trying to make himself more like he used to be, but lacking the memories to do so. Dick is a confident and friendly guy, turn that on it‚Äôs head. He should feel just as alone as he did the night his parents died.

5. Make the Nightwing cops more interesting. They all wear different Nightwing era costumes, so make them act like how Dick did during that series/period. They should all represent a different trait of Nightwing.

6. The Nightwing cops and Dick should be completely unrelated. They shouldn‚Äôt work together, or even meet. He just sees them and admires them, until a few issues in. The Nightwing cop in the disco/NTT costume saves him from some random thing, and the sight of the costume brings a sense of familiarity. 

7. The reveal of the new Dick finding about Nightwing would be about 6-8 issues in. He‚Äôs looking through old photos, and sees himself in the Nightwing costume. For the next issue or so, he would be doing more digging on his past life as a hero. He finds out about all the Robins, the Titans, and who Bruce really is. Bruce can appear as Batman, paralleling their first meeting. 

8. Have Dick try to be his own hero, not called Nightwing, but instead Flamebird. (There could a Superman cameo of him telling the story of the Nightwing and Flamebird of Krypton) He makes a crappy costume, tries to fight crime, but is beat up by some thugs and retreats. His short crusade as Flamebird only lasts an issue or two.

9. The main villain the Nightwings fight would be Nitewing from the 1996 series. Change his origin slightly to make him an obsessed Nightwing fan who was saved by him at one point, and is disappointed by the new Nightwing cops. He should be written as us, the fans of Dick Grayson, who just him to be Nightwing. He can meet Flamebird and deduce his identity as being the original Nightwing, and lash out at him for not being the hero he wants.

10. This arc should only go on for like 10-14 issues, no more. It doesn‚Äôt really matter how he gets his memories, maybe from Wally touching him like at the beginning of Rebirth, or Barbara can take him up on the trapeze like in the famous Birds of Prey #8. In a previous arc of Nightwing, Barbara had some weird serum that contained Dick‚Äôs memories and stuff, maybe she could use that? I‚Äôll leave that for you to decide.",DCcomics

With his three other friends eating and him up for seconds, There was a woman happily getting food for her daughter as the gangster walked up to her, and took the food off of her plate and smacked it onto his. His friends laugh in satisfaction. While the woman runs off in fear. I turn and say to the man, "" Well aren't you a dick."" He takes one look at my pale skin and lean but somewhat built body and dirty blonde long hair blue eyed, big nosed face, he laughs and so does his friends too. He begins to walk off, so I decide to say "" Yeah walk away little pussy, you'll never have enough words to correctly tell people how ignorant you-""

He punches me square below the eye and I fall to the ground. His friends instantly jump up and everyone else in the restaurant begin to run and scream in a panic. All four men start hitting me with a huge amount of kicks and punches while I'm still unconscious on the floor. One man that was eating peacefully jumps in and kicks down one of the men and says "" all right that is enough, you win!"" While this is happening I slowly get up and see the the four men arguing with the nice man. My whole body is in pain. One of the gangsters pulls out a knife and as if at ease, sticks it into the man's stomach who protected me. He falls to the ground with a loss of breathe and blood splattering to the floor. Two of the gangsters begin to beat him to death. And the one who knocked me out and a smaller scrawnier one turns to me and begins to say "" You fucked up now motherfucker!"" I stuttering say with my hand down to where he is pointing the knife near my body "" M- My bad dude, I- I Just don't... like men that treat woman like shit.""  He swings it towards my  hip and I move in a sliding motion with my arms out to stop his one arm holding the knife. I peel his finger back while the other man starts swinging fists at my head, one hits me square in the ear and a ringing becomes loud. By then I have the knife and quickly jab it into the scrawny guys neck and he falls to the ground as if he was no longer a living thing. There was blood all over my eyes and I can barely see what is going on. It was the bigger guy who knocked me out, He grabbed a chair and as I clear my eyes I see the metal leg of the chair smack my face. Luckily I don't go unconscious this time but fall to the ground with a huge headache. He kicks me in the neck while I begin to try and get up again. Police sirens are heard from the outside and gunshots are heard quickly after. the two other gangster were shot dead and the bigger man tries to run while clambering over me, I grab his leg and pull him down. I was in raged , hitting him over and over again. Feeling my knuckles begin to smack across his bloody bruised face. I get tackles by a cop feeling his belt on my back and handcuffs quickly go tight onto my wrists. He was dead. I beat him to death and stabbed the other man in the neck.  Am I a murderer!? The police sit me on the curb and put a blanket around my bloody bodied shirt. Ambulances and at least 4 cop cars are on scene. The peaceful man was killed and the other men who were beating him to death were shot multiple times. So that means I'm the only one that survived the violence. The cops ask me a series of questions but I still cant hear from the gunshots and the punch to the ear. I stay silent in shock.

clto2q,Opinion: I am glad they brought Jason back!,"I was thinking about this recently because of all the Jason content out at the moment. Including Lego Family Matters, which a lot of people love because of how wholesome it is as a movie. I was looking at all the Jason content and thinking that it is a really good thing that they brought Jason back.

  
I know there are a lot of people who liked the idea of Jason remaining dead and symbolising ""Batman's greatest regret"" or some bullshit like that, but the issue is that it was bullshit. They didn't retire Robin after Jason. Instead, they replaced Jason with Tim, literally the worst choice to replace Jason because he was an untrained ""normal"" kid from a normal home. The fact that Bruce trained him doesn't matter. He still took a kid out there for the Joker to kill again.

  
That was the other thing, DC also didn't retire the Joker either. So what was the point of killing Jason except for the shock value? The reason Under The Red Hood was so good was because Red Hood was 100% right in his interpretation of Bruce after his death. Bruce's action after Jason died could be interpreted as Bruce never gave a shit about Jason. Moved on the first chance he could to the next kid and he wouldn't bat an eye if said kid also got killed because, at the end of the day, those kids lives didn't matter as long as Batman and Joker kept playing their game.

  
So overall, I am glad they didn't waste a good character for some bullshit symbolism that DC itself didn't care about, let alone the majority of the fans. Red Hood is an awesome character and Scott Lobdell might be a weirdo sexist creep but he has done his bit to establish Red Hood as someone people actually care about and not just a forgotten memorial that stood in one dusty corner of the Bat cave.",DCcomics

It's a random bit of a deep dive into Cyborg's history, and tying him to something like this could give him something to expand his own mythology having links to this planet. Plus maybe some way to bring Cyberion into this perhaps, and explains the robot side being ""alive"" in that it's techno-organic (or as one of the JL trailers said, Organic-Biomechatronic cos that does sound kinda cool)

Donna Troy has had so many origins, but I had one for either the Titans show or if the WW movies bring her into it. She was created by Demeter from magical clay to be her ""daughter."" But she was ""corrupted"" by Ares, or Phobos and Deimos. So Demeter and Aphrodite wiped her memories and sent her out into the human world

Vixen: I'd mix her Action Comics origin with G Willow Wilson's Return of the Lion. She was from Zambesi but fled a a child when her uncle led a military coup and killed her father. She grew up in New York, then she met a refugee child from Zambesi who told her of the dictatorship her uncle was running still. So she returned to overthrow him and liberate her country. After his defeat a government is elected and she is made an Ambassador for Zambesi

[Last year, Scott Snyder and Tom King saw a lot of love for their work on Justice League and Mister Miracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/abjbxk/announcing_the_winners_of_the_rdccomics_best_of/). And halfway through 2019, there's a to talk about. Scott Snyder has an impressive slate on his hands, with minis like *The Batman Who Laughs* and *Batman: Last Knight on Earth* being well-received. Brian Michael Bendis has had a busy year, adding Wonder Comics, *Event Leviathan*, and Wal-Mart Batman to his current workload with Superman and Jinxworld. Meanwhile, writers like Mark Russell and Sam Humphries continue to do great work under the radar. On the TV side, *Titans* has a lot of new competition from *Young Justice: Outsiders*, *Doom Patrol*, and *Swamp Thing*, thanks to DC Universe.    

It's 2019, and like Bon Jovi, we're halfway there. What do *you* think have been the biggest hits of the year?

Their license is expiring this year, so making the US editors aware of this shitty situation could hopefully lead to some changes... I already tried sending a message to DC Comics Facebook page but I got no answer, and the ""contact us"" page on their website is not available... Do you know any other way to contact them?

c8rnmx,How much more charitable work Batman must do in order to stop people from complaining that Batman should do charitable work?,"Movies, games, comics, animation, in everything Batman-related piece of media, you are bound to see Batman doing charitable work. Donating money directly, doing it indirectly, holding balls at his manor to raise funds to a number of causes, etc. I cannot think of any comic book character that has done more charitable work than Batman.

Regardless of that, the number one Batman-related hot take is how Batman doesn't truly care about people. He is just a crazy rich man that wants to punch poor people. If he wanted to do good, after all, he would do **CHARITABLE WORK**.

So, how much more charitable work should we see in Batman-related media in order to convince the hot takers that, yes, Batman does charitable work?

bvsak9,A Plot for an Elseworlds style Movie about a teenage Superman,"Plot:

The film begins at the Kent Farm in Smallville, Kansas. The night is quiet. Jonathan and Martha Kent, a homely young couple, are watching the stars one night. Jonathan sees a shooting star and tells Martha to make a wish. Martha solemnly wishes for a child. The two go inside. As they're asleep, a light comes down from the sky and crashes into the cornfield. This wakes the two up and they head outside, Jonathan equipped with a shotgun just in case. They go and find the light and it turns out to be a large silver pod. The pod opens up, revealing it to be a sleeping baby. Martha takes the baby inside.

Twelve years later, the baby has grown to be twelve and is named Clark. Clark is at middle school one day and is hassled by some bullies. One of them tries to punch Clark... and he breaks his wrist. The bullies run off in terror, calling Clark a freak as they do. This causes Clark to break down and cry. He goes home and talks to Jonathan. Jonathan, unable to tell his son the truth, simply tells him he's special. This cheers Clark up somewhat and the two go out for ice cream.

Few years later, Clark is seventeen and attending high school. He's displaying more super abilities, mostly super strength, super speed, and x ray vision. He uses these powers around the barn to help with chores. The only person who knows about these abilities other than his parents is Jimmy Olsen, the dopey second-in-command of the high school's newspaper team. He mostly encourages Clark to look through girls' clothes. At high school Clark has a crush on local popular girl Lois Lane, though he's too shy to ask her out. One night, while attending a party, Clark gets drunk and finally asks her out. She says that she'll think about it.

Overjoyed and drunk, Clark begins to float. He flies high above the party house and then flies back to Kent Farm though he crashlands in the field. In the field he discovers the pod he came to Earth in. Not knowing how to operate it, he presses a randon button. This prompts a hallographic recording to come on. The recording is from a man named Jor-El who claims to be Clark's real father. Jor-El tells Clark what he really is.

Enraged that Jonathan and Martha lied to him, Clark confronts them. They tell him that they didn't mean to lie and go on to explain that they didn't to put that on his shoulders. They show Clark the blanket that he came to Earth in. He looks at it and finds that it's not a blanket but rather a suit with the house of EL on it. Clark puts on the top half but doesn't put on the bottom half, instead going for some red jeans. He then throws on a large red trench coat. Martha jokingly calls him ""Superboy"" and Clark likes it.

As that's going on, government agent Amanda Waller arrives in Smallville to investigate Clark. She's speaks to an unknown employer on the phone. She checks into the local hotel.

Back at the farm, Clark is preparing to fly again. After a few failed tries Clark is finally able to fly. He flies to Lois house and knocks on her window. He show her that he can fly and offers to take her for a flight. She accepts and they fly across the town to other cities, including Metropolis and Gotham City, before heading back to Smallville. Unbeknownst to them, Waller is watching them and recording notes. Once they land, they discover that a bank robbery is in progress. Clark suits up and quickly stops it, debuting as Superboy for the first time.

Over the next few days, Superboy defends the town from all kinds of crime. With his friends and family backing him up, he becomes the small town's superhero. Waller records her last notes and her employer tells her to set a trap for Superboy. Clark and Lois attend the prom. While Lois is going to fix her makeup, Waller kidnaps her. Clark, worried, goes to check on her and finds a message left by Waller instructing him to go to the local church.

At the local church, Waller has Lois tied up to a stake and is preparing to burn her. Superboy arrives and he and Waller fight. As that happens, Lois cuts herself free from the ropes using one of her makeup tools. She jumps down and she and Superboy fight Waller together. At one point, Waller is prepared to shoot Lois. But Superboy takes the bullet for her and discovers that his skin is bullet proof. They defeat Waller and tie her up before leaving. The police find Waller and take her to the police station. There she tells them that she knows Superboy's secret identity but the police just ignore her, saying that they don't want to know who he is. This shuts her up.

A week later, life has returned to normal. Clark and Lois are leaving on the last day of school when they get an alert of a crime being committed from a nearby radio by a supposed ""Toyman."" Lois smiles as Clark runs to a phonebooth and changes into his costume. He then zooms out and flies above the city, ready to stop more crime.

Post Credit Scene 1:

Waller is sitting in her jailcell. Suddenly, two masked men run in and free her. They take her to a secret government building and it's here that we discover the agency that she's working for: Checkmate. And it's being run by none other than Lex Luthor.

Post Credit Scene 2:

Superboy flies to Gotham after getting a text from an unknown number. He lands on top of a building and waits. A large dark shadow suddenly falls over him and he breaks a smile. A bat screeches into the night.

The End.

Stopped reading  like 30 years ago. But I love getting my nieces and nephews comics. My nephew Nitro is the one most into them. He is 11. I started him off with an early Spider-man anthology as well as one for Batman. 

He emailed today and asked for ""Lantern"" comics. I responded ""You mean Green Lantern? Sure. Love to."" He wrote back, ""Not just Green Lantern, Uncle Crash,  Red, Blue, Indigo and Orange"" (he didnt use commas so I'm assuming these are all different. But maybe there is a Red Blue Lantern? Haha).

Like all the different Venoms in Marvel, I am not familiar with these variations or the best stories or collections to get him. I'm also poor so I'm hoping to maximize any purchase for him.

bvu19z,How Powerful would Scarecrow be with a Yellow Ring,"So, I saw a video recently that went over all the times a Batman villain got their hands on a power rings, with the one that stood out being Scarecrow getting a Yellow Ring. Now this combination is frankly the most obvious thing in the world. Master of Fear gets his hands on a Ring that channels the emotion of Fear. It's like the most perfect pairing of ring and wielder you can get.

That got me wondering though, Scarecrow has only ever gotten his hands on a Yellow Ring once, during Blackest Night and even then only got to use it briefly, so we didn't get a proper grasp on how powerful he was.

Frankly, I'm of the mind that Scarecrow could easily become one of if not the most powerful Yellow Lanterns out there as Fear is litterally what he's all about. Unlike most Yellow Lanterns who simply use fear to intimidate or inspire fear in others, Scarecrow worships fear, he's spent his whole life studying it, he has a freaking Doctorate in Fear and even has the word Scare in his name. 

Dude probably knows more about fear than anyone and it's likely he could use a Yellow Ring better than any other lantern, but what do you think? Do you think the reason the writers keep the ring away from him is because he'd be too strong with it?",DCcomics

bvusaq,[Discussion] How would a non-superhero show in our world look in the DCU?,"So, occasionally we see celebrities cameo as themselves in superhero movies. Jon Stewart doing a fake Daily Show segment in BVS Ultimate Edition comes to mind. But it makes me wonder, what would shows in our world look like if they existed in the world of the DCU? For example, I've been binging Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and I can't help but imagine an episode about the gang thing to capitalize on a recent alien invasion. Just something fun to consider. What do you think real shows would look like in the DCU?",DCcomics
bvuupo,Is there an explanation why the flash got hits?,"[https://youtu.be/pzlL5ouF0Ao](https://youtu.be/pzlL5ouF0Ao)

So I just saw this video, and honestly a lot of the flash videos have been showing him getting hit, but how?

Like one example is quick silver (I know its marvel) , or the flash tv show, when they show the speedsters point of view, everyone is slow as F, so even if Darkseid ""predicted"" his move, the flash can still EASILY dodge it right..??

Like how are you going to hit the flash, if you to him is like sloth?? 

Is there an actual explanation about this? (oh yea sometimes the flash got hit by normal dudes lmao)

or just ""it has to hit the flash "" thing? (so the story can goes on)",DCcomics
bvuz73,"When the Flash runs, how does his speed actually work","So if he run New York to Vegas, would it seem like it took however long it would take for us to run that distance, or would it seem like he went fast to him? And if he perceives himself as moving at super speed, how would he react to something being in front of him when at super speed? Basically If I was to run from New York to Vegas, would it seem that long to the Flash even though he got there in a few minutes at most. This is probably a stupid question, but I was just curious. I know he is moving at super speed so it probably wouldn‚Äôt make much sense this way, but if he still has to run are his legs just moving really fast?",DCcomics

bvvnjd,Is it worth picking up the Superman titles again?,"I used to be an avid Superman fan, and eagerly awaited each issue as it came. When they announced Bendis was taking over both titles, I was excited, initially. That excitement died down after the Man of Steel miniseries came out, but I figured I'd follow the main series when it came out anyway; sure, Rogol Zaar wasn't exactly groundbreaking (or even interesting) but maybe that's just because Bendis was still trying to figure out what worked, and what didn't; surely, if he was so hyped by the company, he must be capable of delivering good work. And, you know, I'm not as big a fan of Marvel as I am of DC, but I checked out the big stuff, and I did like Ultimate Spider-man for the most part, so I figured he's capable of delivering when he wanted to.

So, yeah, I read a bit of both Superman and Action Comics for a few months, but quickly dropped both titles. I mean, I guess some people like them, but they just weren't for me, especially the way that some characters were way OOC in Bendis's writing.

Recently, however, I've been thinking about getting back into the recent Superman comics. Not because of any particular thing Bendis has done (I've not really been paying attention to what he's doing), just a kind of 'I really want to read some fresh new Superman stories' kind of thing.

Is it worth it, though? Has Bendis at all improved since the first few issues? Or should I just wait until the next writer picks up his series in a few years and hope it's at least somewhat decent? Are Lois and Jon back? I've heard through the grapevine (though haven't actually read so I can't really verify) that Jon's been aged up and Lois apparently left Jon in Space with Jor-El, or something? - is this a permanent change, or has it been revealed that it's a clone or mind control or some such? I'd really like to hear what you guys think of it before I decide whether or not I should get invested again.",DCcomics

(Collects Swamp Thing Vol. #1-13 &amp; The House of Secrets #92) The beginnings of Swamp Thing written by Len Wein &amp; drawn by Bernie Wrightson.

I feel everything after Len Wein's run isn't worth reading, but you could choose between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long list but i really have no idea where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for the best runs to read Red hood, Cyborg, Green Lantern, Blue Beetle, Harley, Zananna, The Joker, Nightwing, Robin (both Damian and Tim)  comic books. Thanks for the help as I am very new to comics.

I've read year 1-5 and Ground Zero but have slept on the games themselves. My question is are how do the events of the comic Injustice 2 tie into the game? Will I be able to read the series and get everything from it without intention of ever touching the game? Also is this still ongoing?

bjyq5f,How to read a comics run instead of reading everything chronologically?,"I used to read a lot of DC comics, and with a lot I mean I started at the start of Rebirth on the chronology and read like 90% of the series.  No surprise, I got burned out as it took ages for stories to progress and I spend a lot of time reading characters I didn't care too much about. At this point I stopped reading...  


Now I'm attempting to get back into comics with my favorite hero and a series that I LOVED, Green Arrow. So I looked which comics I had, what comics I didn't have yet. And I see it ended, Sadly I guess but its nice because then I can read it start to finish. And issue 50 has as description. ""Spinning out of the events of JUSTICE LEAGUE: NO JUSTICE and HEROES IN CRISIS! "" Now I start to worry, so I need to read No Justice and Heroes in Crisis, and everything that's important to read before those stories. And at that point it will probably again become too much.

  
How do I read a run like this? Do you just focus on the actual run? Should I first read important events so I can see where the event places within other comics? How do you deal with this?",DCcomics

bk0tcs,Will the Rebirth Deluxe Edition collections be continuing?,"Title.

I'm planning on (finally) collecting the rebirth runs (at least for Supes and WW) and was wondering if I should go for the trades or the Rebirth Deluxe Editions.

Price isn't too much of an issue but from what I understand the deluxe editions collect about two trades' worth of issues and cost just over twice as much, which is more than reasonable for the oversized hardcover format.

Basically my only concern is over whether or not they'll be continuing releasing the runs in deluxe format. So I was just wondering, are they? And if not, would it be best to just get the trades or to pick up what deluxe edition there already are then get the trades once I reach the end of the deluxes. In particular I'm thinking about Superman, Wonder Woman and possibly Batman. I'm gonna hold out until the Justice League by Scott Snyder deluxe comes out later this year because I've heard bad things about Justice League rebirth.

So TL;DR I'm looking into whether I should collect the rebirth/current runs for Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman in their Rebirth Deluxe format or in trades because I don't know if the deluxe lines will be continued and if not, I don't know if it would be better to just get the trades or no.",DCcomics

For me it would be cool to have that old school look with the harpoon for a hand translated to the movies but doing this would come with many problems. Not only would it be difficult for the actor, Jason Mamoa, to act without his left hand, which also brought up the idea of the water hand but I feel like that would be a cheap way of doing things. So, I just wanted to hear your guys opinion on Aquaman having a harpoon for a hand and if it would really work on the big screen.",DCcomics

Zatanna

Phase 2:

But ... DC universe gives me access to the new stuff.  Things that came out one year ago today.   I'm super excited about that.  Especially bendis's Superman which should be out next month.  

But what other on going titles should I check out?  Also, who are the big DC writers who I should always check out no matter what?
